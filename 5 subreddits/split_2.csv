The Proud Family stages a protest during the festival, Wizard Kelly has them arrested, and after a month of negotiations, the town chooses to take down the statue and replace it with one of a slave girl that Smith owned named Emily and renamed the town as Emilyville.

Honestly, the history buff in me is deeply irked by the underlying message that, ""History is Written by the Winners"" (and it doesn't make a lot of sense that a slaveowner would hide that past in the first place). That said, I think the whole episode strikes me as a counterpoint to the Simpsons', *Lisa the Iconoclast* from season 16, where Lisa finds out that the town's founder, Jebediah Springfield is actually a notorious fiend, but when she had the option of exposing him at the festival honoring him, she chose to keep quiet to keep everybody happy.",0,1,0,0,0,0

\- Another commenter mentioned an air horn...

\- Subscribe their phone # to a wake-up-call service

\- Mount a smoke detector just outside their door, take up smoking, and every morning direct a few gentle puffs of cigarette smoke at the smoke detector.  (Tip: you might want to get ear plugs)

\- Assuming they lock their bedroom door:  You knock (loudly), mabey try a few times, get no response, then call 911; tell the 911 operator that you tried to wake you parents but got no response and ask for a wellness check.  Because, after all, it **IS** possible that they are genuinely incapacitated.  **Lots** of excitement will then ensue; might wake up the whole neighborhood.

"To be honest, I don't remember a ton of times my parents ""played"" with me.

I was lucky, and my parents were super involved when I was growing up. My mother was a freelance artist, so she was always home. My father was very involved in community things - he ran boy scouts, did church stuff with us on the weekends, coached half my soccer teams, etc. etc.

We would def spend quality time together, always had meals together, and we were an affectionate, pretty tight family.

But the only real like, ""Playing"" I can remember them doing is my Dad and I used to play chess together, and the family would sometimes do board games or the like.

Even though we were together for most of the day, play was left to the kids and our friends, who were over pretty regularly. While other kinds of quality time were for the whole family.

My point in all this is simple: While OP is phrasing it in a shitty way, I do think there's a wholesome, reasonable family unit where you're not actively playing with the kids, all the time.

Comments on the article

* Trafficking in Texas is horrible, watch your kids! (Article in no way affiliated with anything to do with trafficking in Texas. It's just a crazy dude from NC who kidnapped one person from TX. But yes. Please watch your individual kids online behavior. )

* HE'S STILL PRESIDENT TRUMP x a few. I'm not sure why, but it seemed to be invisible arguments

* A few calls for vigilante justice, which really make no sense since the legal system literally worked immediately. It's just wanting to go out and do something violent, which spoiler alert doesn't make those people sound as upstanding as they think it does. ""Let's just go take this guy out of police custody and then do violent things instead of letting him be tried in a court of law and forced to serve his sentence!"" Thanks for making NC look forward thinking guys

This is why I try not to read comments on articles but the article said nothing about prior offenses which is *their favorite thing to do* and I figured I would look in the comments to see if anyone said anything was missed. I mean like even a bar fight at 14. 

So its likely (but not for sure) that he doesn't have any criminal record, or at least any significant one. So I think what that should say to people is:

Stop freaking out about the invisible Boogeyman of the creepy looking old man who might jump out of the shadows at the mall and mass traffick someone and think about just talking to your kids about how the people they meet might seem nice or ok, even not have any criminal record but to let you vet them first before they meet them or go off with them and if they DONT want you to meet them for some reason then that's a red flag. 

I mean literally let your kid know that. Tell them that if they have a friend that for any reason they are afraid to let you meet then there is maybe something dangerous or not ok with that friendship and make sure they feel comfortable talking to you.

>During a Q1 earnings call with investors on Thursday, a top Walgreens executive said the company potentially overreacted to concerns of theft in their stores and that shrinkage in inventory has stabilized over the last year.

Closing stores over concerns about theft may be a good talking point publicly but in earning calls top executives of retail stores sing a different tune. 

In large cities people generally have lots of options. I grew up in a major metro and didn't even know Walmart sold groceries until I visited a Walmart in another state. The ones I had always been to just sold clothes and electronics.

That's because for those of us who fell victim to this behaviour, we were laughed at or told we 'got lucky'.

One NYE, I had a friend over. I had zero sexual interest in her; not my type physically or emotionally. The last thing I remember of that night was remarking that my beer tasted funny.

I woke up in the morning to find us naked in bed together. I was really confused and she laughed saying ""Oh don't you remember last night?"". It turned out she'd been sneaking aftershock (a strong liquor) into my beers all night. I know we had sex because she phoned me the next week to advise that she'd given me chlamydia. Angry, I told her I'd never have slept with her if she hadn't spiked me; she said ""That was a hurtful thing to say"".

Have to say, when I've relayed this before on reddit everyone was very supportive. That's not the reaction I had IRL; I was mocked, belittled, told I must have wanted to fuck her else how did I get it up?

"The FDIC ideally prefers to shop around failing banks before the bank's regulators shut them down. However, that wasn't possible here because SVB's depositors began a major run on the bank. That leaves the the FDIC with (1) a lot of insured deposits in a temporary DINB (deposit insurance national bank); (2) an even bigger bunch of uninsured depostors; and, (3) a huge volume of loans that, in many cases, are of high quality.

The FDIC cannot simply attempt to sell the good loans on a piecemeal basis. That'll take too long and cost too much. In addition, a number of these loans are subject to ongoing funding commitments. If those commitments aren't met, the loans will become practically worthless. So, you can bet that the FDIC is frantically trying to put together a deal that will result in one or more other banks acquiring these loans.

"Reminded of the Sargasso Sea stories of William Hope Hodgson:

*“I am writing this in the saloon of the sailing ship, Homebird, and writing with but little hope of human eye ever seeing that which I write; for we are in the heart of the dread Sargasso Sea—the Tideless Sea of the North Atlantic. From the stump of our mizzen mast, one may see, spread out to the far horizon, an interminable waste of weed—a treacherous, silent vastitude of slime and hideousness!*

*“On our port side, distant some seven or eight miles, there is a great, shapeless, discoloured mass. No one, seeing it for the first time, would suppose it to be the hull of a long lost vessel. It bears but little resemblance to a sea-going craft, because of a strange superstructure which has been built upon it. An examination of the vessel herself, through a telescope, tells one that she is unmistakably ancient. Probably a hundred, possibly two hundred, years. Think of it! Two hundred years in the midst of this desolation! It is an eternity.*

*“At first we wondered at that extraordinary superstructure. Later, we were to learn its use—and profit by the teaching of hands long withered. It is inordinately strange that we should have come upon this sight for the dead! Yet, thought suggests, that there may be many such, which have lain here through the centuries in this World of Desolation. I had not imagined that the earth contained so much loneliness, as is held within the circle, seen from the stump of our shattered mast. Then comes the thought that I might wander a hundred miles in any direction—and still be lost.*",0,0,0,1,0,0

If anybody remembers the Jessie Blodgett case where her best friend saw a snuff film of a woman being tied up, gagged, raped and then murdered, he watched it over and over until he eventually attacked a jogger but she fought back like hell, unfortunately she couldn’t ID him. He realized he had to pick someone that knew him so he picked his best friend someone he could sneak attack that would let him in. She was killed in her own home because some creep had to live out a fantasy. I’m not saying anybody who watches Anime is like this but the ones like this person with this kinda attitude just bother me because we don’t know when a fantasy is going to become real life. Japanese women nor Iranian women should be fetishized like this, we all know no one would agree to that willingly so what’s stoping some disgusting creep from kidnapping someone and forcing them to live out their fantasy.  


Maybe I’m reading too far into it but this just seems like a dangerous mindset to me, it’s not like it’s a foreign event to hear about a woman who has disappeared being found after being held somewhere for some ungodly reason. Jaycee Dugard who was subjected to things I don’t even want to imagine for 18 long years!

"The way you look is the number 1 factor when it comes to success in dating. That’s not to say personality doesn’t matter. It might be 50/50, let’s say it’s 50/50. What needs to be considered is that looks are the first 50. They’re chronologically first. When you see someone you automatically apply positive or negative traits to them depending on how they look. If you’re ugly and you talk a lot, you’re annoying. If you’re attractive and you talk a lot, you’re outgoing. This has been proven. In one study participants were given three pictures each, one of an ugly person, one of a decent looking person, and one of an attractive person. And then they were given 27 traits to apply to each of these people. All the attractive pictures got the good traits. And all the unattractive pictures got the bad traits. In another experiment participants were given an essay, and this essay was attached to either an attractive or unattractive author, but it was all the same essay. And when asked to critique this essay, the attractive person’s essay got all the good reviews even though it was the same. A study on kids in 7th grade found that aggression increased popularity for attractive students and decreased popularity for unattractive students. When you see someone your brain has a chemical response based on the way their face and body is built, and you have a bias towards them, either positive or negative. This is the reason looks have priority over personality, because your looks determine how your personality is perceived. And it’s not even a matter of whether or not you’re shallow. Everybody does this. So you might even think that you’re going for personality but really you’re going for looks. Because your whole perception of personality is based off how they look. Men like 61.9% of women on tinder while women only like 4.5% of men. When men rate on attractiveness on a scale from 1-10 it comes out as a perfect bell curve. But when women rate men, it’s like 5% are attractive and the rest are butt ass ugly.",0,0,0,0,1,0

"Jesus H. Fucking Christ on a cracker! The self-pub bullshit book a publisher wouldn’t touch with a ten-foot pole doesn’t faze me, but the number of people who highlighted his hateful rhetoric is…horrifying and astonishing. 

It’s always the “liberal arts” degrees. 
First of all, art and literature is vitally important to a well functioning society. People have already been dumbed down enough we don’t need to work on abolishing the arts anymore than has been done. 

Secondly, take someone like me: I worked my ass off and got As and an occasional B in all my classes for my degree in Crime Scene Technology and Forensic Science. 

After graduation I had a stellar internship and worked as a CSI tech, investigator and assistant at the Fish and Wildlife department for the chief biologist at our local division. 

When my boss went to make my job full time and keep me as an investigator and his assistant because I was damned good at it, the state informed him that due to budget cuts he could only utilize an assistant that already existed and was all the way up at the main office in Tallahassee, FL while we worked and had our lab out of Boca Raton—all the way down at the other end of the state. (He was so disgusted by everything they cut he ended up resigning to teach forensic biology full time) So I couldn’t stay and work for a stipend and had to go find work elsewhere. 

I had references, education, experience, but I had to compete with homicide detectives who were looking to retire into the CSI role despite having no formal training. Over and over I was told I needed more experience, and over and over they also said they wouldn’t accept internships or volunteer work. 

I was quickly disillusioned as I learned that law enforcement is a boys club and as a girl I was second rate. Mind you this was 15 years ago so it may be different now but I doubt it. 

I could have moved out of state for work but I didn’t want to leave my entire family for a job that didn’t pay very well and was mentally draining (crime scenes are often gruesome and traumatic, I’ve seen some things that I can’t forget) so I ended up having to work shitty retail jobs for years to stay afloat and really struggled for a while, with my fancy diploma at home. 

Now, I’m extremely fortunate to be working my dream job as a novelist, but I STILL have student loans to pay off, for a degree that isn’t worth the paper it was printed on outside of using my education on all that forensic science and for writing purposes. 

TL:DR Fuck these fucking fuckers who mock everyone with a student loan, especially when they use it as a tool for misogynistic bullshit.
