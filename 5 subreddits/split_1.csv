Then they'd have to track all the cases and beg everyone to get vaccinated and close the school for 2 weeks or more until they were sure they'd caught everyone who had it which was an expensive hassle for the school district and all the families who had to find child care since kids weren't in school and they expect of medical treatment for the kids who are sick in any long-term after effects.

2.) Here's an anecdote on wage discrepancy: I got my first job over 10 years ago as an engineer with a BS and an MSc in engineering, 6 months later the company hired another engineer whom I was responsible for training. I found out a few months later that the guy I was training was making 15k more per year than I was with a BS which he took as long to get as it took me to get a BS and an MSc. He was neither more experienced, nor more qualified, nor harder working than I was. I should add that I negotiated my offer as high as I could when I took the job. As such, the arguments against pay equality and pay transparency are garbage in my view. 

Knowing what I knew, I got experience and left that company as soon as I could justify to myself that I had enough experience to move up at a different company. Companies that under pay women relative to men are stupid - they lose talent they've invested in, as my first employer did.

"I used to think conspiracy theorists were just ‘dumb’ or alarmingly gullible.

But, I’m really beginning to lean towards (the theory of) them having a combo of low critical thinking skills and previously undiagnosed narcissistic personality traits.

Like flat earthers or covid denialists, they have to willfully chose to believe the opposite of accepted scientific evidence and believe that they’ve somehow figured out something that millions of scientists and specialists either couldn’t fathom (or secretly agreed to falsify for no specific gain over decades of study and career building) for what?

How?

Especially considering many of the conspiracy fans I’ve known have *at best* a 7th grade grasp of science and history, yet they (and the mysterious secret experts on you tube) in their tiny towns *with no access or inside knowledge about the topic* have finally uncovered concepts that have stymied the most brilliant minds for hundreds of years.

That’s got to be some sort of personality disorder, right?

Like how reasonably intelligent people are intelligent enough to KNOW they’re not the most intelligent, but a truly unintelligent person can’t really fathom how stupid they are because they cannot understand what true intelligence is capable of understanding?

I think some of it starts as edgelord trolling but the true believers have to WANT to believe.

They need to put in effort to ignore provable fact for a clunky theory that adds nothing to the world except making them feel like they’ve seen the ‘truth’, or are a one eyed man in a world of blind people.

But take the oral supplements? Do not play around with your magnesium or your potassium. They're both very important to your heart functions and normal rhythms. Messing up that balance will absolutely cause anxiety symptoms because your heart rate will be erratic.  

It's a good idea to see if you are truly deficient in any vitamins and to have standard blood work done. Vitamin d is a really common deficiency that causes depression symptoms and it's super easy to manage with sunlight and weekly supplements. Not a big deal at all, but it's not going to be solved with over the counter crap. You need pharmaceutical grade supplements to make a real difference.  Especially if you are struggling with ARFID, you should be getting regular blood work at least every 6 months. I have gastroparesis and so I deal with a lot of food issues too, blood work is vital to make sure nothing is failing because of my lack of nutrients.

Sudden cardiac deaths amongst athletes is rare, but happens commonly enough. In a [2018 report ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29678777/) in autopsies performed  on athletes with sudden cardiac deaths between 20001-2015 (that is, before any COVID vaccine ever existed), a total of 19,740 autopsies were completed in the study period: 12,395 in subjects age 18-65 years (adults) and 385 in subjects age 7-17 years (children). There were 201 sports-related adult deaths at an incidence rate of 0.76-1.49 per 100,000 participant-years. Of the deaths, 74% were witnessed. Of the adult cases, 68% (n = 136) were due to cardiac causes, with coronary artery disease the most frequent cause (n = 90 [45%]). Structural abnormalities were common in adult cardiac deaths; 51 (38%) had cardiac weight ≥500 g, and 75 (55%) had left ventricular wall thickness >15 mm. Of the 15 child deaths, 5 (33%) were arrhythmogenic or presumed arrhythmic, and 5 (33%) were inherited cardiomyopathies (2 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 3 arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy).",0,1,0,0,0,0

"Haven't read too much into the case, but if you advertise say 4 hours of PTO per pay period, that's pretty cut and dry.. you get those 4 hours regardless of how much you worked because it's per pay period. If the job you accepted said ""4 hours of PTO per fully worked pay period"" then I could see an argument about not rewarding full PTO if you didn't meet the fully agreed upon working hours for that pay period. If it was the former, case should have been thrown out and the court should have told the employer to update their employment terms. If it's the latter then I agree with them, and you should be using that as a metric when deciding to work for that particular company.. if enough people won't work there because you're the only company docking PTO based off worked hours and not automatic per pay period then you'll get less prospective employees and that'll force them to change their benefits.  

edit: Also per the title, I don't think anyone has ever thought PTO is part of ""salary."" Salary is what goes into your bank account. Total compensation is when you start figuring in fringe benefits of your employment such as PTO/healthcare/stock options/etc. When you're offered a job for $80,000 a year salary you're getting *paid* $80,000 a year, it's not $70,000 a year plus $10,000 a year worth of PTO. In the same way a company isn't going to tell you your salary is $120,000 a year because you're getting an $8,000 healthcare plan, $10,000 worth of PTO, $12,000 worth of stock options.",0,0,0,1,0,0

IMO stopping these feelings isn’t the right solution. I think the main problem is that platonic intimacy (emotional closeness, hugs, etc) is something that generally isn’t allowed in society between men. A lot of men are touch starved and what they really need is a hug, but sex is portrayed as the only form of touch that is acceptable for men.

Even emotional closeness between men and women is something that isn’t really allowed on society.

Men have so much pressure to be this and that, stuff that is impossible to live up to and that’s intentional. The impossibly high expectations for men and women in society is intentional.

If this man had good friends with whom he could have platonic intimacy, the desire for a relationship and sex would be a lot easier to deal with.

Men need therapy and to break free of the societal expectations too, or else they will continue to be depressed and fixate on sex as the solution to all their problems.",0,0,0,0,1,0

Suppose you have $1 million, and are shopping around for something to invest it in. Do I buy an SVB loan, which might make me 3%, and carries a large risk of default? Or do I buy 10 year US government bonds at 3.75%? Obviously the latter. 

So the loan has to be sold at a reduced price to find a buyer, not just because of the counterparty risk, but also because there are better options for investing your cash right now.

"!explanation Alright, so, my parents recently split. We started on a one week/one week thing, and I decided I didn't want to be with my mom after a while, with a whole series of events including but not limited to gaslighting, and stalking. Tuesday night, I tell my mom I don't want to stay with her. Wednesday, I don't go with my sibling to her house. She flips out, calls the cops on my dad to say he's kidnapping me (he wasn't.) And starts blowing up my phone about how she's throwing away my belongings because I'm a minor and they're in her house. Which, she said meant she had full jurisdiction over them. (She didn't, and I could have sued. I didn't know this at the time.) I went back, went in to dig my cross stitching stuff out of the kitchen garbage, and left. She didn't bother me until I left, at which point, she started chasing after and yelling at me, jumping into the back of my dad's truck to stop us from leaving. She was constantly signing and yelling at me, when I don't know fluent enough sign language to hold a conversation. (She should know this, I never finished my ASL class because my new school doesn't have an ASL class.) This is all the context you should need going into this. As of right now, I cannot guarantee any of my belongings are safe aside from my rock collection, which is too up high and too heavy for her to get down safely.

Edit: further context.

Alright, so, some of you seem to think I could have done this on my own, and that I was just being petty. So here are a few other things.

My mom has a history of alcohol abuse, has b.p.d, and is not above physically locking people out of places. Furthermore, I'm scared of cars, and as such, don't know how to drive. I'm surprised some of you aren't scared of hundred pound metal objects hurtling themselves at tens of miles per hour with idiots often behind the wheels. Anyways, I also have muscular weakness issues that I'm in physical therapy for. My muscles can't even support my skeleton properly, and it causes a lot of pain. I need a third party there both to drive me, and help me carry things. I wouldn't be able to move on my own, even if I wasn't scared of her.",0,0,1,0,0,0

You wanna know the real shit? The real shit that your mom's generation knows in the back of their minds but will never admit to?

You have to change for the people you love. Especially the people you love the most. Whether that means using different pronouns, or cooking different food because they go vegan, or learning ASL because they go deaf, or being more careful about how you treat them because they were abused. You just do it. You just do it and you don't make any demands because **their life changing isn't all about you**. 

And even if you are wrong about who you are and you're not a they/them **that's your mistake to make. She still has to love and respect you anyway.** That's a parent's job. When I told my dad I wasn't straight he said ""you're my kid. And that's all you ever have to be for me to love you and be proud of you."" That's what being a good parent is.
