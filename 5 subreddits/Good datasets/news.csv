On one hand, PTO is accrued over time worked, so let's say if you take a 6 month sabbatical, it makes sense that you only get half of your usual PTO for the year.

On the other hand, if there's such a thing as ""required weekly hours"" for you as a salaried employee, it's probably time to look for a better employer.",2661,0,27134,27134,,27134,Lupius,Stranger1982,0

I would have focused on this one. Because now, since it isn't a wage, and can be *docked*, previously you could put in your two weeks notice and take two weeks of PTO and never see them again.

Now they can just dock you two weeks pay ""for not meeting production quotas"" those two weeks, and two weeks' worth of wages you've earned goes down the toilet.",55,0,27134,27134,,27134,AcidTWister,Stranger1982,0

"Paid time off is not part of workers' 'salary,' U.S. court rules","> March 15 (Reuters) - Paid time off that workers accumulate is not a part of their salary under U.S. wage law, meaning employers can take away paid leave when salaried workers do not meet productivity quotas, a federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday.

Oh wonderful, I totally don’t see this ruling being abused by scumbag business owners who wanna fuck over employees because they didn’t meet a “productivity quota”. So now employers can just claim “oh yeah John didn’t meet his quota for the week/month/etc so he’s ineligible for any PTO.” 

This ruling has serious consequences for anyone who has PTO offered, including myself. It just doesn’t sit right with me. My job specifically has annual performances but I personally do not have any “productivity quota” because I’m in a position where the work levels fluctuate by business means/needs. I just hope this doesn’t become an excuse by my employer to dock PTO because of some arbitrary ruling.",58,0,27134,27134,,27134,fullload93,Stranger1982,0

"Paid time off is not part of workers' 'salary,' U.S. court rules","Healthcare is run and operated by extremely greedy money hungry people. This is no surprise.

They want to squeeze every cent every single dying human, while squeezing every cent out of the underpaid, overworked, over stressed workforce.

The goal is for these healthcare workers to save up enough money, so that they themselves can drain all their savings into end of life care.

It's an absolute disgrace. I'm a social worker in a rehab facility and the state of our healthcare is absolutely abysmal.

Change needs to happen, and our elected officials are happy enough collecting paychecks from insurance companies and hospitals that they have no incentive to change.

Republican, democrat, black, white, religious, atheist, gay, straight, Nazi, communist. It doesn't matter who you are or what you believe, or what lies deceived you. All your money will eventually end up in the same place, the hospitals and insurance, unless something is done.

My role is directly involved in doing so, I've seen the inner workings of our healthcare and just how absolutely fucked it is.

You know who's deciding on if you or your loved ones deserve critical life savings care? Computers, algorithms, analytics.

You take a 75 year old man, crunch in their diagnosis, their health history, compare to the 10,000 other people in their same position, crunch numbers, estimate their outcomes, and base their insurance coverage on that.

You know what isn't involved in this process? Common sense, compassion, care, the human touch. It's all cost effective measures. We are simply a commodity, waiting to be exploited. We, humans, that is. Mothers, fathers, sons, daughters. You are simply the means which justify the ends, profits.

Edit: way til you see how mental health agencies treat their employees by the way. Mental health is treated like an assembly line, where you chew up and spit out fresh new college grads. There's a reason why tons of social workers/healthcare workers fizzle out in the first few years. Because, again, the whole system is fucked.",28,0,27134,27134,,27134,Richard__Cranium,Stranger1982,0

"Paid time off is not part of workers' 'salary,' U.S. court rules","Haven't read too much into the case, but if you advertise say 4 hours of PTO per pay period, that's pretty cut and dry.. you get those 4 hours regardless of how much you worked because it's per pay period. If the job you accepted said ""4 hours of PTO per fully worked pay period"" then I could see an argument about not rewarding full PTO if you didn't meet the fully agreed upon working hours for that pay period. If it was the former, case should have been thrown out and the court should have told the employer to update their employment terms. If it's the latter then I agree with them, and you should be using that as a metric when deciding to work for that particular company.. if enough people won't work there because you're the only company docking PTO based off worked hours and not automatic per pay period then you'll get less prospective employees and that'll force them to change their benefits.  

edit: Also per the title, I don't think anyone has ever thought PTO is part of ""salary."" Salary is what goes into your bank account. Total compensation is when you start figuring in fringe benefits of your employment such as PTO/healthcare/stock options/etc. When you're offered a job for $80,000 a year salary you're getting *paid* $80,000 a year, it's not $70,000 a year plus $10,000 a year worth of PTO. In the same way a company isn't going to tell you your salary is $120,000 a year because you're getting an $8,000 healthcare plan, $10,000 worth of PTO, $12,000 worth of stock options.",7,0,27134,27134,,27134,marinuss,Stranger1982,0

"US maternal death rate rose sharply in 2021, CDC data shows, and experts worry the problem is getting worse","I have three children, my oldest is fifteen and my youngest is four months. I live in Texas. I can't even express how much shit has gone downhill between the birth of my first and my last. My doctor prepped me for his limitations if I had any complications when Roe was overturned. He told me that it wouldn't matter what he personally wanted to do, hospital policy would dictate whether or not he could step in and with things in such a legal gray area I shouldn't bank on HCA choosing my life over a lawsuit. 

This last pregnancy was the first time I feared for my life due to having a baby. Maybe that's foolish and I should have always just been prepared, but I've never had a doctor tell me point blank that I needed to be hyper aware of any symptoms and get treatment immediately and out of state if possible. I feel lucky in the sense that he didn't shy away from the realities because that isn't the experience most people have in a red state.

It was also by far the worst care I've ever received in the hospital. I had given birth four years prior in the same hospital and it was a totally different experience. The staff was cut in half, easily. I went into early labor and when I got there I waited in a large room with nine other women who also were in labor but there weren't rooms or staff available. Everyone working there was trying so hard, there just wasn't enough of them. One of my L&D nurses told me they had been working on a close to skeleton crew for over a year.

They also don't even have nurseries anymore. I had a c-section and my husband had to leave to take care of the other kids at night. I was expected to be solely responsible for a newborn without being able to move the bottom half of my body, on no sleep for over 24 hours and a cocktail of drugs. It was horrifically unsafe. My nurse snuck the baby out for me so I could sleep but told me she would get fired if anyone found out. And before anyone even needs to ask, yes of course my hospital bills were over 12k after insurance and I was charged for a nursery. So spare me any bullshit that it's ""about the babies"" because it's definitely not.

I live in a conservative, rural state and am very scared of becoming pregnant. Colleagues of mine who are mothers have told me how few OBGYNs there are in the area and how far they’ve had to travel (2+ hrs) just to deliver a PLANNED baby. I know people who travelled 6+ hrs. In a rural area it’s common to have to travel for specialized care but female reproductive health shouldn’t be seen as specialized. It’s not like we don’t have local hospitals, they just don’t have people who can provide these services. I once posted about this in a post about abortion access and people seemed to think that female reproductive health, including abortion services, is “specialized” and seemed to accept it as a reality of rural living that traveling out of state is the norm. I don’t get it. Having a uterus and being a women of reproductive age is not “special”, there are quite a lot of us.

US jails former Mexican state governor for money laundering,"Former mayor of Matamoros, Tamaulipas and friend of George W. Bush.  Arrested in Italy in 2017.  

""According to the investigations of the SIEDO, Yarrington received more than $8.5 million from the Gulf Cartel and the Juárez Cartel in eleven separate payments to finance his campaign for Governor of Tamaulipas in 1998.""  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%C3%A1s_Yarrington#SIEDO_investigations  

""Yarrington's accusations of his criminal activities began in November 2011, when the slain body of a businessman and rancher named Alfonso Peña-Argüelles was publicly displayed in the border city of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas.[1] Along with the body was a message left by *Los Zetas* accusing Peña-Argüelles' brother of laundering money for Yarrington.[1] On 30 January 2012, the Attorney General of Mexico issued a communiqué ordering the past three governors of Tamaulipas – Manuel Cavazos Lerma, Eugenio Hernández Flores, and Tomás Yarrington – to remain in the country because they were being investigated for possible correlation with the Mexican drug cartels. After a court case in San Antonio, Texas, the U.S. federal agency known as the DEA accused Yarrington of laundering money for Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel from 1999 to 2004, his time as governor.[2] This information was obtained after Antonio Peña-Argüelles, an alleged high-ranking drug cartel member, was arrested and claimed that Yarrington had ""direct personal relationship with Zeta leaders.""[3] In addition, Yarrington was accused of plotting the assassination of Rodolfo Torre Cantú, the former candidate for governor in Tamaulipas' 2010 elections; the ambushed that killed Torre Cantú was allegedly carried out by Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez, the supreme leader of the Gulf cartel.[4][5] According to the DEA's protected witness, Torre Cantú was assassinated because he affected the interests of a construction company that the Gulf cartel was sponsoring.[6] Moreover, Excélsior notes that Torre Cantú was also killed because he did not have a good relationship with Yarrington and did not guarantee agreements with the cartels.[6] However, Egidio Torre Cantú, the brother of Rodolfo, took his place and became the governor of Tamaulipas after his assassination, and allied with the Mexican Armed Forces to combat the cartels in hopes of avoiding what happened to his brother.[6]""

[Another article](https://lawandcrime.com/crime/fired-new-orleans-cop-rodney-vicknair-sentenced-to-federal-prison/)

>""The court is obligated to protect other children from unacceptable criminal behavior, and the court is of the opinion that this sentence does so,"" said Lance Africk, who was nominated to the court by President George W. Bush. ""The fact a police officer would engage in this brazen and outrageous conduct is unimaginable.""

Africk also ordered Vicknair to undergo five years of supervised release after finishing his sentence for molesting the teenage rape victim. Vicknair had pleaded guilty to one count of deprivation under color of law.

A former emergency medical technician and 13-year veteran of the NOPD, Vicknair drove the teen to Children's Hospital for a ""rape kit"" exam in May 2020.  Shortly thereafter, he began a grooming process that started with sexually charged texts and culminated in rape in September 2020, when Vicknair went to the girl's house, locked her in his police vehicle and touched her genitals under her clothing.

> ""He made sure she was victimized a second time,"" Africk said.

This is not the first time Vicknair has gotten in trouble:

>In the years prior to his conviction, Vicknair was issued multiple suspensions and a letter of reprimand. Two disciplinary actions were related to his behavior toward women, including an incident in 2009 in which he inappropriately retrieved a woman's personal information and used it to summon her as she walked in the Ideal Food Market parking lot.

The victim was not present at the sentencing because she was ""not doing well,"" her mother said. ""Last week was extremely emotional to her to the point where she couldn't find it to come back. It was tough.""

The sentence was pre-negotiated.

Not mentioned in the DOJ's press release, however, is that Africk had rejected an earlier deal which called for 7 years in prison. The proposal was backed by the DOJ's Civil Rights Division.

Africk refused to accept the offer, calling it ""unjustifiably lenient"". That left Vicknair with three options: Go to trial, plead guilty anyway, or return with a harsher deal.

The defense got back to negotiating.

Eventually, they and the prosecution agreed to a sentence double what was first proposed. That was deemed acceptable by Africk, who sentenced Vicknair yesterday.",448,0,6737,6737,,6737,lightiggy,lightiggy,0

"Exxon starts up new Beaumont, Texas, crude unit","March 16 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) has successfully started up a new $2-billion crude distillation unit (CDU) at its Beaumont, Texas refinery, said Karen McKee, president of Exxon Products Solutions on Thursday.

The new CDU adds 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) to the refinery's capacity to break down crude oil into feedstocks for motor fuels.

In a statement issued on Thursday, Exxon set the refinery's capacity at more than 630,000 bpd.

""The unit is started up and we're just ramping up rates at present, but it's operating very reliably,"" McKee said in a phone interview.

Exxon began the initial startup of the new crude unit in late February, people familiar with plant operations told Reuters. read more

""We're well over 200,000 bpd at this point,"" McKee said. ""We're pushing rates right now so I would anticipate we'll get to full capacity soon.""

Exxon has said it wants the crude unit to reach its full 250,000-bpd capacity by the end of March.

The Beaumont refinery expansion, built between 2019 and 2022 and which includes a new hydrotreater, allows Exxon to take advantage of crude oil it produces in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico.

McKee said the Beaumont refinery is well-positioned because of ""tremendous logistics in and out of the site"" to supply diesel and other motor fuels from the new crude unit to U.S. or international markets.

McKee said the biggest challenge was pushing on through the COVID-19 pandemic.

""We had the courage to keep going on this project despite the many challenges both with getting work done and also demand for products and cash flow during the pandemic period,"" McKee said.

The new crude unit is equal in size to mid-level refinery and boosts the Beaumont refinery's capacity by 68%.",1,0,24,24,,24,hazelnut_coffay,hazelnut_coffay,0

1.  The app, even if necessary to function properly, harvests a lot of user data that the company has repeatedly failed to control.  (just last year their employees accessed data on US journalists)
2.  There is no independent judiciary in China.  The CCP controls the courts.  You can't expect Bytedance to refuse, let alone challenge, an invasive attempt by the CCP to access user  data.
3.  I don't understand why we allow a double standard with countries who don't allow Western companies to independently operate, let alone enter, a foreign country.  While we allow companies from those countries that blacklist Western companies without a problem?  There should be some basic element of reciprocity here.

I think it boils down to a trust issue where one cannot trust the CCP.  Because even if we believed Bytedance to take corrective steps (which they have repeatedly failed), there is nothing to stop the CCP besides trust.",57,0,145,145,,145,cgmcnama,TheAngelMutants,0

WSJ News Exclusive | U.S. Threatens Ban if TikTok’s Chinese Owners Don’t Sell Stakes,"OF COURSE what would really help with data privacy in the US is if there were more robust laws to protect consumers.

OF COURSE Meta, Twitter, and Google do a ton with data that is way beyond what the average person even understands.

OF COURSE the US has installed spying tools all across our own telecommunications, monitoring pretty much everything we do online.

That can be true and it can also be true that TikTok has been unable to properly assure **anyone** that data flowing through the app isn’t able to be read/shared with the CCP. In fact, there has been little driblets here and there that suggest the opposite. Namely, that Chinese-based personnel snooped on America journalists and Chinese-based developers have complete DB access.

In short: China is a black box. There may be absolutely no real concern here. There may be a massive spying campaign. Odds are it’s somewhere in between.

The problem is that we can’t know. It’s like how they handled COVID—we still don’t know the origin, we’ll never know the origin because China will never cooperate, and it’s clear they lied for quite awhile about the seriousness of the issue, even after everyone knew about it…even still today.

But I’m guessing shills for China are going to invoke the “whataboutism” distraction tactic again by bringing up American social media companies collecting data on its own citizens, which is a bad thing, for the record, just a false equivalence because in no way is it the same as a **hostile nation** collecting data from the citizens of their enemy. 

Can you imagine if Russia’s VK had penetrated the US the same way TikTok has? You would have to be nuts to still use social media run by a hostile nation.",-10,0,145,145,,145,LookAtThatBacon,TheAngelMutants,0
WSJ News Exclusive | U.S. Threatens Ban if TikTok’s Chinese Owners Don’t Sell Stakes,"I wonder if, after the US bans TikTok (and for the looks of it they will, since both parties agree on this!), other nations will finally adhere to the Chinese method of handling online spaces as another ""national border"" that needs to be guarded, it looks like we all agree that this is the logical step of any sovereign nation. Maybe not banning foreign apps, like the US and China will, but maybe storing all the data locally is something that all nations will be interested on doing. Or maybe not and it will be limited to banning Chinese shit and nothing else, US aligned countries should follow suit in regards to TikTok but not really care about US apps.

Whatever something that I genuinely believe will happen is blocking any Chinese made app for entering the US led countries, allowing TikTok was clearly a mistake so I doubt they will let something like that to happen ever again.",-1,0,145,145,,145,Secure_Ad1628,TheAngelMutants,0

"Tyson Foods to lay off 1,700 workers, close two chicken plants","The plant in Glen Allen, VA is getting replaced by a new plant in Danville, VA. That area needs these jobs. All the chickens will just be redirected. The plant that is closing is very old and needs a lot of work. It’s also in an area that is in high demand for suburban living. Houses in this area are going for $600,000 and up. Another poultry company could buy the building with the equipment or a developer could buy it and sit on it for ten years before building and still make mad money. 

It sucks for everyone there. I’m an inspector and we were thrown. There have been rumors of this plant closing for decades and it finally happened. We will be moved to open spots in our district or to an entire new district and moving expenses will be paid. Some of the people who work for the plant hdd as be been there for 20 years. They’ve started at the bottom and worked up to leads and supervisors and QA.  So many will have to start at the bottom wherever they go and it sucks.

Vermont high school banned from tournaments after refusing to play team with transgender player,"Sometimes medical conditions can exclude a person from sports. It doesn't mean they are invalid as a person or should avoid treatment, but just like cis people who have conditions that require steroid or other treatment, it means they are often disqualified from competitive sports. For MTF trans athletes, that may mean they don't qualify for the womens league, but can still join the mens (open) league.  

For everyone saying its just a small amount of MTF athletes, that argument can be reflected back as well. Why challenge the entire concept of womens sports for a small amount of athletes? Respectfully the sporting thing to do is acknowledge the physical advantage (particularly for high schools minors not undergoing hormone treatment yet) and not interrupt half of the population's only competitive option.

Vermont high school banned from tournaments after refusing to play team with transgender player,"Just to preface this comment, I’m not trans, and will admit that I could be better informed in this area. I’m just hoping the engage in the discussion to learn, if I get anything wrong, I hope you’ll take the time to educate me. But my thoughts on this:

1. Yes, trans issues in women’s sport are absolutely being used by the right wing as a dog whistle and to distract people from other atrocities they’re committing.

2. There in my opinion is no easy solution to this discussion. I think it is more nuanced than people on either of the debate are willing to admit, and it’s not helpful to use such hateful rhetoric (from both sides) when trying to discuss these issues.

3. I see a lot of the discussion here references biological changes that occur with HRT. Acknowledged, and if the science supports it, then I agree that people that have fully transitioned using HRT should be able to compete with the gender of their choosing.

4. Not all trans people have undergone HRT, particularly in youths, which is where this issue is being debated. If you want to argue in favour of them competing with the gender in which they identify, then you will legitimately end up with unfair competition in sports. The trans community includes those who haven’t medically transitioned, and if you’re going to create a barrier that says that you have to have undergone HRT to compete, you’re just creating a whole sub-section of exclusion. As such, in my opinion, you either need to be in favour of all trans people (HRT or no) competing, or none of them.

5. In this instance, we’re assuming that the athlete hasn’t gone through HRT due to their age. I don’t know if they were on hormone blockers or any other form of treatment, but if the athlete in question hadn’t medically transitioned, I understand the position of the team who forfeited. 

6. Lots of people are still learning about this subject. Calling everyone who uses the phrase ‘biologically male’ a transphobe isn’t helpful. You’re taking people who may just be trying to learn and engage in the community and making them an enemy. You’re just creating an echo chamber.",-6,0,12966,12966,,12966,Sarksey,raider1v11,0

Vermont high school banned from tournaments after refusing to play team with transgender player,"*sigh* here we go again. 1. Olympic hormone limits for the female division have been used on cis women with abnormal conditions in the past. 2. If you are so worried about an advantage of body and not of hormones, then why is Michael Phelps so celebrated when he is basically an x-men mutant.

1. The olympics bare people from the women’s division based on testosterone levels that have been suppressed for about a year (testosterone has been proven to be a performance enhancer). This includes *both* trans/cos women. There have been women in the past that due to naturally high testosterone have been barred from play, *unless they suppress it with the same rules as trans women*. These women include Caster Semenya, Margaret Wambui, Francine Nayonsaba, and Aminatou Seyni (all runners for some reason?). They have been like this their entire lives so any “they grew up that way, thus have an advantage” arguments would also apply to them, but they can still play if they meet the requirements.

2. The idea of someone having a biological advantage is not new for the olympics, but one of the obvious natural mutants is one of the most revered US swimmers. Micheal Phelps has several uncommon traits that combined basically make him a human-fish. First, his wingspan is almost unnaturally wide at 6’7” while only being 6’4” tall, and he has oddly short legs with massive feet. Second, he has basically doubled-jointed arms/ankles that give him a range of movement that others physically can’t match. Third (and most important), Phelps has a mutation where his muscles produce less lactic acid. What is lactic acid? It’s the chemical that tires you out. So he physically tires slower and regains stamina much faster. If Phelps (the *celebrated* US athlete) here is allowed to compete with all that, I don’t think being a bit taller and having broad shoulders is much of an issue.

These rules are consistent and applied to everyone equally. Is it perfect, no. But if you had **NO IDEA** about these **OR** “*just don’t care*” and are throwing a fit about trans women competing, then it wasn’t thinking critically about the “*fairness*” of trans women in sports (and how it applies to everyone else).",-43,0,12966,12966,,12966,JennaFrost,raider1v11,0

Vermont high school banned from tournaments after refusing to play team with transgender player,"For the people who are genuinely curious about the physical effects and “advantages” I’ll explain as best as I can:


HRT changes more than just appearance. When a trans woman takes estrogen, there is an observed decrease in both strength and lean body mass. The claim that these women have biological advantages is not true; for example, what about the 6-10% of women with PCOS, which gives them increased testosterone levels? Or foods that raise testosterone levels?

“But red, their bodies have larger bones! Isn’t that an advantage?”

This would actually be a disadvantage. The combination of larger bones with lowered testosterone levels from HRT would mean a trans woman has a proportionally larger body to move without having the required power to move it. Even if you COULD prove that having those larger bones, lungs, and heart give an athlete an advantage after that testosterone drop, that’s already proportional to a persons size, which widely varies in people to begin with. There is no specified context for the accusation. 

There is a study that examined effects of gender-affirming therapy on transgender athletes. However, this study only covered eight trans people who are long-distance runners, and the findings were that their performance was about the same as trans men who HAD NOT YET STARTED HORMONE THERAPY. (No heightened testosterone levels)

On the other side of a screen, startup leaders raced to withdraw funds online – so many, in fact, that some told CNN the online system appeared to go down. Still, the end result was a modern race to withdraw funds, which House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry later described in a statement as ” the first Twitter-fueled bank run.”

Also worth noting that there is in issue with jurisdiction that the judge seems to be willfully ignoring because the plaintiff's mailing address is in Tennessee (i.e. not Texas) and they only had a legal presence in Texas after setting up a shell corporation there just one month before filing this lawsuit seemingly to ensure the appeal is seen by the 5th Circuit which is probably the most right-leaning appellate circuit in the country.",98,0,726,726,,726,thatoneguy889,thatoneguy889,0

Electric car stores will be restricted in Mississippi.,"Am Mississippian. Here is the logic. 

Car companies are not allowed to directly sell to consumers. They must use franchise models. These state laws (that are very common) were used to keep Ford from owning every part of the car process. 

These laws have proved sticky even as the auto manufacturing business became competitive. Dealers have a clear vested interest. That's a lot of jobs and money that suddenly vanish as consumers simply go to Ford.com and start buying cars. Yeah, it's 10% better for all the citizens but devastating for those dependent on the dealership. Ergo, they lobby strongly for the status quo. 

Secondly, car sales are huge sources of state income. 8% of Mississippi's state taxes come from new car sales. Suddenly, that money goes to Dearborn or Detroit.

US stock fall as bank worries spread to Europe; Dow down 500,"The truth is that all the $5 trillion printed as a pandemic response eventually sloshed its way straight into bank deposits, because there was nothing extra that could actually be produced, nothing extra to be invested in.  And this is from the Fed's own numbers:

https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/understanding-bank-deposit-growth-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-20220603.html

> A notable development in the U.S. banking system following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the rapid and sustained growth in aggregate bank deposits. Total deposits at domestic commercial banks rose by more than **35 percent** since the end of 2019 and stood at around **$18 trillion** as of the fourth quarter of 2021 (Figure 1).

And it's still true that there is nothing that can be actually made with more spending and more investment.

There was therefore nowhere for the money to go than to drive up the price of everything.  The result is that the bottom 50% in income have been priced out of everything from food to transportation to housing.  They're just gone from doing anything in the economy other than barely surviving and using up whatever savings they have.  The supposedly rosy jobs outlook is due to people having to work second or even third jobs to try and make ends meet.

A woman who falsely claimed she was raped and trafficked by an Asian grooming gang has been jailed for eight-and-a-half years,"Yeah, she deserves to be punished.

But what about all the rapists and traffickers who don't even get 8 years, or how even 8 years wouldn't be enough for an actual rapist? I hope everyone here cheering for her incarceration thinks on that.

Call me jaded but I can't help but realize that when there's a rape, everyone's focus is ""Oh the poor girl"" or ""The perp is a bastard"", yet no mention of punishment or demands for harsh punishment. In fact, when I bring it up everyone's very quick to say ""Don't you know, harsher punishments don't work"".

Yet when a woman makes a false rape accusation and is sentenced here, everyone's up in arms cheering and going ""She should be permanently institutionalised!"" ""Her sentence should be 3 times as long!"" and so on. Oh so apparently harsher punishments suddenly work and are worthwhile on female false accusers but not on male rapists?

The misogynistic bias is a bit sickening and gives me strong witch trials vibes (Even though, again, she does absolutely deserve punishment). Please save some of your fervour for punishing the actual rapists too, thanks.",-17,0,8155,8155,,8155,H_Bees,CommanderMcBragg,0

I worked until close but the lot was always half full with stragglers walking the mall while stores closed and employee cars. 

I walked out to my car, unlocked it with my key and started home. As I was leaving the parking lot I reached from my radio. It was an aftermarket Alpine, because in high school, you spend money on stereos that are worth more than your car. Why else work right? 

The radio was gone. Well, the Alpine was gone, replaced by a stock Datsun radio. WTF? I pull over and look around the car, it is clean. No McD's bags on the floor, no papers from spilled school bags, no napkins on the floor. WTF? This isnt' my car. 

Drove back to the lot, saw my car parked. Parked next to it, got out. My light metallic blue car looked awful similar to the silver car I just got out of in the crappy lights of the parking lot. I waited a bit to tell the owner of the car I stole by accident but they didn't show up in 5 or 10 minutes I gave them so I just left. There were only so many key cuts and ours matched. no idea what the odds were on that.",471,0,29060,29060,,29060,SXTY82,Thetimmybaby,0

"He mistakenly entered a stranger’s Tesla. The app let him drive it, he says.","I work for the family taxi business and have since I left school. 
When I first started, my place in the pecking order was, when a taxi was nearly falling apart from high mileage, a new car was purchased for my Dad or my Mum as their new car, and all the taxis filtered down a spot, and I got the oldest one. 
The first one I got had about 300,000 miles on it. It was from a time before remote central locking, so you needed the key to open it, but the lock on the door had been used so many times that anything key shaped would open it. 
Also, the ignition barrel had, at some point in the past, had three quarters of the key snapped off in it that no-one had been able to remove, so all you did was stick the tip of any other key into it and turn it to start the car, then remove said key and put it in your pocket. At the end of the journey, you got the key out your pocket and turn off the ignition. 
The car was actually in good working order, but we had ten vehicles so we replaced one every four to six months, and before long I got another one. 
That car, was sold locally to someone and I never saw it again until about a year and a half later, fifty miles from home. I went to a cinema there with a friend and parked next to my old car. Me and my friend noticed it immediately. It was nosed into a space next to the one I had reversed into. 
And as we were reminiscing about the laughs we’d had in that old junker(And that it was still driving), I got out, used my car key to open it, and the tip of my key to start it. 
I reversed it out the space, turned it around and reversed it back into the same space then locked it back up again. 
It will be long scrapped now, but I often wonder if the owner(s) came back, remembering driving into their parking spot, and finding it reversed there. Did they wonder if the misremembered doing it themselves? 
It was in the exact same spot. Just turned around.",5,0,29060,29060,,29060,Glorious_Sunset,Thetimmybaby,0

The only possible scenario I can imagine here is the victim driver left their NFC keycard on the center console reader OR left their phone in the car.

We pull the car up and they go through it and say it's not their car. Well about that time the group of girls rolls up and says they realized it wasn't their car. Hilarity ensues. Both groups had a bunch of weed in the car so the first group didn't catch it till later. They all exchanged numbers and went to the club afterwards.

Inflation in Argentina surges past 100 percent in historic spike | Inflation News,">Inflation in the South American country of Argentina has risen past 100 percent for the first time since 1991, according to the government’s latest consumer price index.

The National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC) released its February report on Tuesday, pinpointing Argentina’s annual inflation at 102.5 percent as the country continues to suffer from one of its worst economic crises in decades.

In February alone, inflation rose 6.6 percent, with food and beverages identified as the category of items most affected. INDEC credited the 9.8-percent increase in food costs to steep prices for meat, dairy and egg products.

The latest inflationary jump arrives as Argentina contends with a historic drought, its worst in nearly 60 years, and wildfires in areas like the northern Corrientes province.

The country is a leading exporter of soybeans, alongside the United States and Brazil, as well as other agricultural products like corn, wheat and other grains.

But with crops failing in Argentina’s fertile grasslands, known as the Pampas, industry experts have slashed the country’s expected agricultural yields to levels not seen since the turn of the century. High temperatures, believed to be sparked by climate change, have beleaguered the country since May 2022.

Argentina has the second largest economy in South America. But for much of the last century, its market has been notoriously volatile, with a debt crisis in the 1980s spurring chronic hyperinflation throughout that decade.

The inflation crisis hit a peak in 1989 with rates reaching more than 3,000 percent at certain points.",41,0,431,431,,431,ethereal3xp,ethereal3xp,0
Inflation in Argentina surges past 100 percent in historic spike | Inflation News,">“There’s just nothing left. There’s no money. People don’t have anything, so how do they buy?” said Irene Devita, 74-year-old retiree shopping for groceries.

>She told Reuters that she had been recently forced to forego a planned purchase of tomatoes as food costs outstripped her ability to pay.

Imagine getting to the store and suddenly tomatoes are out of your price range.

Even if people do have money, it's useless. The country can't import much because you can't get dollars out to foreign sellers. The country can't sell bonds because they're blocked from participating in financial markets until they get out from under their IMF deal and, even when they do, they've basically leased their future to the Chinese in some weird currency swap that will end up doing more damage than good.

If Russia taking direct action against US property isn't concerning to you, then it should be emphasized a Russian victory over Ukraine would have serious ramifications for the US economy.

The US does about $1.1 trillion in business with Europe annually and a significant portion of that business would be at risk by the destabilizing effect a Russian victory would have on Europe. And countries like Poland and Lithuania (and soon Finland and Sweden) would almost certainly request a permanent NATO military presence, which they have a right to as NATO members, and which would probably consist largely of US personnel. And those two issues would draw US resources away from Asia and the Middle-East, emboldening countries like China and Iran to further their interests in those regions.",16,0,2256,2256,,2256,Imminent_Extinction,VengenaceIsMyName,0

Don't get me wrong. This case is absolutely horrifying and I can't even begin to imagine how I would feel if this happened to me or someone I love. Even one person is too many.

Let's run the numbers for fun. Meta has 85,000 workers. Let's assume a SUPER high number like 250k a year average. Remember Meta employee tens of thousands of minimum wage workers all over the world so that 250k number is massively high. At 250k a year that's 21 billion in salaries. Let's double that and round WAY up! 50 billion.  That is still HALF of their profit last year. So they could literally double their workforce to 170,000 and still make SEVENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN PROFIT. Laying off 10,000 people only saves them 2.5 billion a year, a paltry 2.5% savings.

Comments on the article

* Trafficking in Texas is horrible, watch your kids! (Article in no way affiliated with anything to do with trafficking in Texas. It's just a crazy dude from NC who kidnapped one person from TX. But yes. Please watch your individual kids online behavior. )

* HE'S STILL PRESIDENT TRUMP x a few. I'm not sure why, but it seemed to be invisible arguments

* A few calls for vigilante justice, which really make no sense since the legal system literally worked immediately. It's just wanting to go out and do something violent, which spoiler alert doesn't make those people sound as upstanding as they think it does. ""Let's just go take this guy out of police custody and then do violent things instead of letting him be tried in a court of law and forced to serve his sentence!"" Thanks for making NC look forward thinking guys

This is why I try not to read comments on articles but the article said nothing about prior offenses which is *their favorite thing to do* and I figured I would look in the comments to see if anyone said anything was missed. I mean like even a bar fight at 14. 

So its likely (but not for sure) that he doesn't have any criminal record, or at least any significant one. So I think what that should say to people is:

Stop freaking out about the invisible Boogeyman of the creepy looking old man who might jump out of the shadows at the mall and mass traffick someone and think about just talking to your kids about how the people they meet might seem nice or ok, even not have any criminal record but to let you vet them first before they meet them or go off with them and if they DONT want you to meet them for some reason then that's a red flag. 

I mean literally let your kid know that. Tell them that if they have a friend that for any reason they are afraid to let you meet then there is maybe something dangerous or not ok with that friendship and make sure they feel comfortable talking to you.

Germany: 12-year-old girl killed by two under 14-year-olds,"A 12-year-old girl was stabbed to death by two girls younger than 14, the public prosecutor's office in Koblenz announced on Tuesday.

The girl, from Freudenberg in North Rhine-Westphalia, was killed with ""numerous knife wounds"", said senior prosecutor Mario Mannweiler. Both of the suspects were from the victim's circle of acquaintances and as they were under 14, not of criminal age.

According to Mannweiler, the two suspects were handed over to youth services. No further details could be given on the course of the events, the motive, the behaviour before and after the crime, as well as the whereabouts.

According to the investigators, the two girls confessed to the crime.

The girl had been missing since Saturday evening, and her body was discovered on Sunday. According to the autopsy, the schoolgirl died from blood loss caused by knife wounds.",321,0,1081,1081,,1081,flanderguitar,Whichwhenwhywhat,0
Germany: 12-year-old girl killed by two under 14-year-olds,"To clarify: Them not being of criminal age wont mean that they face no consequences.

 It means they can't be charged under criminal law. 

They can howerver face consequences from a civil law suit which I would expect the parents of the kid to file. (This would be the parents fighting for compensation for their damages, therapie cost over losing their child, the pain of loosing their child and so on - the outcome of that can also be put on the parents of the kids if they're ruled to have violated their duty to properly watch over their kids)

Additionally their case will be turned over to youth services. Youth Services will then offer assistance to the parents in evaluating how this could happen and what kind of assistance the kids need. If the parents refuse to take the offered help YS can (and I would be suprised if they wouldn't under those circumstances) take away custody and make sure proper help and assistance is given to the kids.

It is's highly likely (I don't want to write certain but it's pretty much that) that they will be made to recieve mental treatment in the form of therapy. Which might very well include being placed in a proper treatment facility/institution.

A Black man was found dead after he told his mother he was being chased. Police said there's ‘no reason’ to suspect foul play.,"EXCERPT FROM ARTICLE...

""The family of a Black man who was found dead in Mississippi after he warned his mother that he was being chased by white men hurling racial slurs demanded a federal investigation Monday after local authorities said they had “no reason” to suspect foul play in the man's death.

Rasheem Carter, 25, was reported missing Oct. 2 after his mother said he had sought help from police and frantically called her to say white men in three trucks were pursuing him. That was the last day Carter's family heard from him.

On Nov. 2, authorities said they found his remains in a wooded area south of Taylorsville, Mississippi. In a statement on Facebook a day later, the Smith County Sheriff’s Department said it had ""no reason to believe foul play was involved"" though the case was under investigation...

“This was not a natural death,"" Crump said. ""This represents a young man who was killed.""

Crump told reporters that he believes Carter's head was severed from his body and that his spinal cord was found in another location away from his head.

""There is nothing natural about this. It screams out for justice,"" Crump said. ""What we have is a Mississippi lynching.""",7077,0,29111,29111,,29111,Helpful-Substance685,Helpful-Substance685,0

HISD substitute says City of Houston didn't notify her that auction home would be demolished,"For those not in Texas - this is complex.

The auction was done by the county, and they auctioned the property, which is the lot and any structures.  The taxes are owed to the county, which is how they foreclosed and what they sold.  Those sales are as-is, don’t have title insurance, and are completely on the buyer to research before purchase.

The city, however, is the one that demolished it based on a code enforcement process, and they’re right - she wasn’t the owner at the time those actions started or the demolition order was entered.  That’s against the structure, not the property, though.

Two immediate problems:

1/ The city didn’t or couldn’t check if the current owner of the property changed.  While the county made the sale and “owns” the records, it may take a while to actually record a new deed because you have to have the court that ordered the foreclosure and sale authorize the issuance of the new deed to the buyer to close out the foreclosure case.  This is a miss by both sides, though.  They city should check, the county should flag the record.

2/ She didn’t check, and it’s an as-is sale on her.  Now you ask “how would she have known to check?”  That’s part of the tax auction deal - it’s on you.  It’s probably a good idea to check for outstanding violations with Code Enforcement… but that didn’t happen.  She’s learned a hard lesson.

The upside?  An investor will surely want a cleared lot, and $57k is a good price for that.  She can get her money back and maybe more. Past that?  $57k is a small amount for the city to simply settle and either pay her or buy the lot themselves.

Bottom line?  Do your research.  All of it.  This would have been easily discovered through a code enforcement records check and a court search of the prior owners name.",130,0,639,639,,639,mreed911,welkikitty,0

Autopsy: 'Cop City' protester had hands raised when killed,"I'm going to chime in here as a Starlight Heights resident. I live less than a quarter of a mile from where they're trying to build the training facility.

I've been in Atlanta for years and years and I've enjoyed these woods and ponds for over a decade.

The morning of Feb. 6 (my birthday) I woke up and felt awesome, also a little hungover but it was a beatiful day. I picked up my tactical pack and put a small tackle bag and my Springfield Hellcat in said bag. I wore a bright red flannel as I'm going out alone.

To preface this: I am not on Facebook or Instagram. I generally just treat people kindly and mind my own business. I don't ever want to hurt anyone. I didn't know the parameters of this ""development.""

Until now.

I was about to string up a pretty awesome roostertail I've always had good luck with over there. Great fishing out by Prison Farm! Then I saw a barrage of Georgia State Patrol officers coming down the trail with a K9 unit. Super cute Shephard.

I set down my rod and stood up to let my presence be known. I just didn't want to cause any dissention. I wanted to mind my own goddamn business as I usually do. I'm glad I didn't have my dumbass pittie out there with me.

One officer advances with a kinda cheap 223/556 very quickly and exclaims ""GET ON THE FUCKING GROUND!""

I obviously obliged. I have a whole slew of living beings I care about and that care about me; I don't want to get killed.

Knee to the neck.
No body cams.

I promptly let them know that I am armed. (I'm in the woods alone.) They took my pistol. Springfield Hellcat compact 9mm. They didn't ask about the Kershaw on my right pocket but I told them about it too.

An hour later they let me go. They did give me my pistol back. Told me not to insert my mag until I got home. Obviously I obliged.

One of the worst things I did hear was one of the officers saying ""I can't wait until they bulldoze all of this shit."" I'm not even one of the protesters. I live there. That's my home. I have my partner, my two dogs, my two cats, and equity on a home my millennial ass has taken so many strides to buy.

This shit sucks. They murdered a dude with his hands up. Heard about this several days ago. I just want to live at peace in my neighborhood. None of us wanted this. I haven't been as vocal as I should but I cannot refrain from speaking out.

I was so scared my lady would see me with a bullet hole in my head. I'm not usually afraid of much.

That was the second scariest moment of my life.

(The first is when I found my dad after he drowned.)

People need to know these police are unhinged.

Edit: this is the first time I've typed this all out and I really hope it helps to bring light to what's happening over there. I don't want people throwing stuff at cops like the Sunday protest. I just want everyone to be okay. And I'm not. I'm not okay at all.

Edit 2: I was listening to Among The Wildflowers by The Wailin' Jennys and if you haven't heard that song you should check it out. I'm gonna go rewrite this without expletives to have saved. Be careful out there. Cops don't care about you it seems. Just wanted to be free. Weird serendipity but I'm an emotional man.

Edit 3: I'm going to type out everything in a less emotional state and it will be something to help our activists out there. They will recieve the document. I will adamantly say that I don't want anyone to hurt someone. (Apparently that's the job of police in America.) I'm just a little redneck kid from middle Georgia. I used to think they cared.

Autopsy: 'Cop City' protester had hands raised when killed,"This is a bit misleading. The independent autopsy shows that he had his hand raised in front of his body, with bullet wound passing through his hands and forearms at various angles, including longways from his dorsal wrist diagonally through the inside of his forearm, and longways from the end of his Knuckles to the bottom of his palm. This new autopsy explicitly stated that they couldn't determine if he had a firearm in his hands, but not ruling out the possibility of it.

The much more important information provided by this autopsy is that they were able to *confidently* determine that he was sitting down cross-legged. This, in combination with the fact that GA won't release bodycam footage of the shooting itself, is a *much* stronger (and more honest, in my opinion) indicator that the police were likely the first ones to shoot.",5,0,48676,48676,,48676,Dr_Phrankinstien,SoiledPantaloons,0

I love hearing stories about American quality of life victories! The bare minimum Americans should be entitled to is what Europeans and brits are entitled to!

As AI and automation becomes more mainstream and culturally acceptable, I believe our working hours will be further reduced for a better work life balance.

by the way.. the holy trinity is three drugs when used together you get a high not unlike street drugs give you.

"Charles Schwab shares head for worst day ever, drop 20% as fears of banking crisis deepen","A little ELI5, so yall can understand what's going on:

When you deposit money into a financial institution (ex. a bank or credit union), you give the institution permission to invest that money. These investments can take many forms - when the institution loans money, that's an investment. In return, the institution basically promises that whenever you want to have or use your money, it will be there, plus a little interest.

A inancial institution fails when it can't fulfill that promise. For example, maybe a lot of people borrowed a lot of money from the institution and aren't paying it back.

In this case, Silicon Valley Bank failed because the central bank of the US (the Federal Reserve) pushed the central bank's interest rates so high. When this happens, people spend less money. As a result, Silicon Valley Bank sold some of its investments at such a significant loss that the bank failed.

Now, most US financial institutions (including Silicon Valley Bank) are insured against failure by the US federal government. In the event your financial institution fails, the government will reimburse each depositor the amount they have in that institution or $250,000, whichever is less.

"Charles Schwab shares head for worst day ever, drop 20% as fears of banking crisis deepen","Couple of quick notes for the doomers.


SV bank was a high risk bank. They invested in start ups with high interest loans. Tbey are basically the loan sharks of the professional banking industry. When a global event causes busy to drop and inflation creates even more revenue drops those loans started defaulting. With loans defaulting SV could no longer manage its funds efficiently and when enough withdrawals occurred they sounded the alarm that they could not payout their accounts. 

The FDIC is a government insurance entity that is funded by banks in case of a bank failing. Its doing exactly what its supposed to do right now. Its being used for exactly what it was intended to be used for.

So we have a high risk bank failing due to an economic downturn in its investment industry followed by an insurance entity taking over and paying out the insured funds. This is not a crisis. This is a problem that had a proactive solution.


Any other banks or financial institutions that have drops or declines are more likely due to speculative fears being pushed for entertainment/viewership. Of course there are also potential factors of economic decline from inflation or supply chain concerns leading to declines in stock prices but for the most part SV has an actual negligible effect on other major institutions. Peoples speculative fear has more of an impact that the actual financial complications.",12,0,10975,10975,,10975,Austoman,whitecastle92,0

*“I am writing this in the saloon of the sailing ship, Homebird, and writing with but little hope of human eye ever seeing that which I write; for we are in the heart of the dread Sargasso Sea—the Tideless Sea of the North Atlantic. From the stump of our mizzen mast, one may see, spread out to the far horizon, an interminable waste of weed—a treacherous, silent vastitude of slime and hideousness!*

*“On our port side, distant some seven or eight miles, there is a great, shapeless, discoloured mass. No one, seeing it for the first time, would suppose it to be the hull of a long lost vessel. It bears but little resemblance to a sea-going craft, because of a strange superstructure which has been built upon it. An examination of the vessel herself, through a telescope, tells one that she is unmistakably ancient. Probably a hundred, possibly two hundred, years. Think of it! Two hundred years in the midst of this desolation! It is an eternity.*

*“At first we wondered at that extraordinary superstructure. Later, we were to learn its use—and profit by the teaching of hands long withered. It is inordinately strange that we should have come upon this sight for the dead! Yet, thought suggests, that there may be many such, which have lain here through the centuries in this World of Desolation. I had not imagined that the earth contained so much loneliness, as is held within the circle, seen from the stump of our shattered mast. Then comes the thought that I might wander a hundred miles in any direction—and still be lost.*",531,0,6264,6264,,6264,frodosdream,black_flag_4ever,0

And that's why American gun laws are broken.

In any sane country, the relevant adult(s) would be prosecuted for negligent homicide. But here in America, we tell people with our laws that your ""right"" to keep a gun at home - in a loaded and ready-to-fire state, where anyone can access it, *just in case* an intruder may break in and threaten your life - is more important than the lives of the people you love.

It's absolute insanity.

Even if they do they do not have access to that floor of the house without direct supervision (not just for this reason, but it’s a big one), they don’t have access to that storage room under *any* circumstances. Even if they somehow got in the room, the safe is buried under some leftover construction materials from our reno. Even if they happen to get that exposed somehow without everyone on the block hearing, the safe is locked, the firearms have locks on and are unloaded, ammo is stored elsewhere. I DON’T EVEN KNOW WHERE THE KEY FOR IT IS. Those belong to my husband as he is the only one who hunts so I have no business ever opening it or accessing them myself, even as an adult. My kids have been introduced to the firearms briefly so that they know what they look like and to start talks about safety early. So they know not to touch and come get help if they see anything that looks like it, but if I’m relying on a kid who thinks dinosaurs are real and a kid who can barely answer his name as my first line of defence for firearms safety I’m possibly the stupidest fucking human on earth.

Rather, employers are passing on to nurses the cost of basic on the job training that’s required for any RN position at any hospital, and then they’re using these contracts to lock nurses into their jobs or risk this devastating financial penalty,” said Brynne O’Neal, a regulatory policy specialist...

This is the key statement here. They're getting on the job training, not an industry certification or accredited educational credits. 

I work in IT and it's a fairly common practice that employers will pay for industry certification training / testing and or educational credits with the stipulation that you have to pay them back if you leave within 2-3 years. My position is that while it's restrictive, that's fair. Those certifications and academic credits will carry over with you throughout your career, past your current employer, boosting your earning capability; they're not cheap to begin with either, and the employer pays for them as a direct line item expense. 

Being indebted for on the job training that doesn't result in either of those things, forget it.

It also gives nurses the option to transfer to its other facilities.”

This is 100 percent complete and unadulterated corporate jargon spewed en masse to confuse and redirect from the real problem: the habitual and systematic abuse of registered nurses as a DIRECT RESULT OF the capitalistic model that strangles the United States’ healthcare system.  I have been a bedside nurse for 12 years and I’d like to state that these cracks were widening well before Covid.  The heartbreaking thing is Covid gave hospitals an excuse to shift the blame of their ineptitude from their incompetence to the pandemic - a mentality that is still pedaled today.  I will share an anecdote: About two years ago, I attended a system-wide meeting discussing the topic of how to address staffing shortages.  Okay.  Good.  Administration knows it’s an issue and they want to bring people in for input on how to fix the problem.  I was mortified.  When you LITERALLY have the executive nurse (second in command behind the CEO) of your hospital tell you, a well-trained and competent nurse, that the problem is not a shortage of nurses but rather a shortage of hands, it means only one thing: that our “leaders” fundamentally misunderstand the problem at its very core.  She then rattled off bullshit suggestions such as putting more cameras on units with a person watching them to get extra “eyes in the sky” and utilizing STUDENT nurses to perform RN duties at a nurse tech’s wage.  Not ONE suggestion involved a baseline wage increase of significance.  Every single decision hospitals make is based on their bottom line: money.  Why can they not understand nurses are the same?  No.  These fucks still believe after the pandemic is over that things will return to business as usual.  You can suck my big hairy balls.

Key part of the press release is that this won't be paid by taxpayers, any uninsured deposits not covered by asset sales will be covered by the FDIC who will turn around and levy a special assessment on banks.

So in effect, other banks are being made to bail out SVB's uninsured deposits, which is in their interest because it saves them from being at risk of a run too.

"US regulators bail out SVB customers, who can access all their money Monday","Just so everyone understands what's happening here, the shareholders / investors in SVP are getting wiped out. They're losing everything.

HOWEVER, the depositors are getting a bailout, even if their accounts had more than the $250,000 limit. This is actually a good idea because it means that companies that have their payroll in svb right now can still pay their employees because the money won't be frozen / lost because of svb's poor decisions.

For anyone wondering why this is happening, assuming you have a job, imagine how much money is in the account that your paycheck is written on during payday. What would happen if the bank which that check was written on went down like svb and your company couldn't access their funds to pay you?

How many paychecks could you miss before things got bad? What would happen when your company can't pay their invoices? How long can your company stay in that state before they go under?

That's why the treasury is supporting/bailing out the depositors.

The investors, who elected the board of directors and hired the executive leadership, they're screwed. They're getting wiped out. But you don't have to worry about your boss not being able to make payroll because the president of your company's Bank made bad decisions.",633,0,5485,5485,,5485,mcjon77,Picture-unrelated,0

Some of the pressure on these institutions balance sheets are treasuries that have yields well below the rate of inflation.  Ironically flight to safety may cause a surge in demand and depress the yield on newly issued treasuries and safe the US a good bit on debt payments vs the current arc.

If the contagion spreads to banks with significant exposure to low interest mortgages, plan for a 2008 level financial crash.

You can check the [transcript](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/janet-yellen-face-the-nation-transcript-03-12-2023/) of the interview. Mostly the interview was just Yellen saying a whole lot of nothing and trying to reassure people. 

The time for a potential 2008-style bailout of Silicon Valley Bank in the US is over. The bank's charter is revoked, the stock of the holding company has tanked, and the assets are being run by the FDIC. Essentially, the bank is gone.

It's not like 2008 when banks were given big loans to stay afloat. Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, Citi, etc are all still around. They got bailout money to pay their debts. They kept their assets. They eventually paid the money back. They are still operating as banks.

That can't happen for Silicon Valley Bank. It's too late.",1265,0,68674,68674,,68674,aguafiestas,cgmcnama,0
Yellen says no federal bailout for Silicon Valley Bank,"Most of the money would be recovered with the sale of assets from the bank.

The big issue is time.

Yellen says no federal bailout for Silicon Valley Bank,"This failure is very very different than those of 2008, where credit risk lead to the failures. This is not a failure brought about by bad loans, but a shortsightedness in the strategy when your customer base lacks diversification. What is puzzling about this scenario is the lack of senior managements ability to foresee a potential liquidity problem when your deposits are so heavily concentrated within the same industry. On top of that, you have VC’s that can tighten the noose on a whim. A loan covenant doesn’t protect you from a herd of VC’s spewing fear among your depositor base. 

Additionally, the investment portfolio should have been of shorter duration. Perhaps those investments were locked in long before inflation had become an issue, but with the industry concentrated business model their investment portfolio should have been structured differently.",21,0,68674,68674,,68674,sonofaww2pilot,cgmcnama,0

Yellen says no federal bailout for Silicon Valley Bank,"Another big problem with trying to find a buyer for those loans, is it's just a terrible time in general to be selling long term historical loans. 

Many of these companies will have been issued loans at around 3% or so, during the decade or so when interest rates were crazily low. 

Suppose you have $1 million, and are shopping around for something to invest it in. Do I buy an SVB loan, which might make me 3%, and carries a large risk of default? Or do I buy 10 year US government bonds at 3.75%? Obviously the latter. 

So the loan has to be sold at a reduced price to find a buyer, not just because of the counterparty risk, but also because there are better options for investing your cash right now. 

The upshot is, that anyone taking on those loans will be paying less than their face value for them, which hurts the amount that's available to repay depositors.",6,0,68674,68674,,68674,entered_bubble_50,cgmcnama,0

Yellen says no federal bailout for Silicon Valley Bank,"Despite some apologists here saying that SVB c-suite could not have forseen how the rapid interest rise will lead to this, I cannot imagine this happening to any bank of this size. Especially given the fundamental flaw they had with funding short term cash requirements with long term debt. A far more likely occurence is 

(1) It's been nearly 12 months since interest rates have been started to rise - and anyone with a fraction of business knowledge and awareness wuold have been aware that central banks will increase interest rates to fight inflation and this will continue for some time.

(2) Any decent finance student can understand that bond prices works inversely to interest rate rises.

(3) Their treasury / risk (which was vacant) / accounting department could have figure out their true mark to market bond prices with a simple excel spreadsheet and I'm sure they have more sophisticated tools than this.

(4) Far more likely SVB have known this risk for multiple months and realise that mark to market pricing will cause them to breach their capital requirements and the resultant depositor & market behaviour and simply ignored it at best and  hid it at worst.

I will not be surprise if months from now we discover clear evidence of SVB C-suite especially (CEO & CEO) knowingly and misleadingly asked their accounting / treasury departments to intentionally not disclose / downplay / reject the consequence mark to market pricing of their long term bonds and kick the can down the road hoping that interest rates will eventually drop (spoiler alert it won't any time soon ....).

The scary part is that I am sure this conversation / play is occurring in multiple other banks. It won't be an isolated case of SVB. This occurred in AIG with their insurance swaps, Bears & Lehman with their CDOs. There'll be plenty of other financial institutions hiding their mark to market bond prices due to some technical rules / timing requirements when in reality it would substantially impact their P&L and Balance Sheets.",5,0,68674,68674,,68674,WWBSkywalker,cgmcnama,0

After receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, and consulting with the President, Secretary Yellen approved actions enabling the FDIC to complete its resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, in a manner that fully protects all depositors. Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13. No losses associated with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer.

We are also announcing a similar systemic risk exception for Signature Bank, New York, New York, which was closed today by its state chartering authority. All depositors of this institution will be made whole. As with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, no losses will be borne by the taxpayer.

To stem the damage and stave off a bigger crisis, the Fed and Treasury created an emergency program to backstop deposits at both Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank using the Fed’s emergency lending authority.

>
The FDIC’s deposit insurance fund will be used to cover depositors, many of whom were uninsured due to the $250,000 guarantee on deposits.

This issue has been building for a while.   How could banks offer 3% mortgages and make any money ?  The answer is clear now, they were selling off MBSes at 2% and taking the spread.

""Small businesses"" lol. 

Anything under $100 million gross is a small business to some of these dynastic politicians and their wealthy ""donors"".

 Most Americans never even see $250k in their account, let alone anything near what these dinosaur ""invaluable"" ""biotech"" startups get (probably just mostly funny money shells owned by the Gulf States and ""diversity-washed"" with rubber-stamp BoDs so they ""look American""). 

And this is a ""both sides"" issue but it is definitely being exploited (and possibly caused) by TexiFloridia, which seems to want to be its own country as they try to out-edgelord one another with book and drag bans, policing education, dismantling democracy, attacking trans people, outlawing womens' rights to their bodies, cuddling up to China and Saudia Arabia, &c.

So if we have another 2008 type crisis, the government will simply make the banks pay huge fees to cover the other banks, all of which will be paid by us. So essentially all the poor people with a bank account are going to be charged fees from the bank to cover these fees. Those fees from the poor will effectively insure the deposits of people who have more than a quarter million dollars. Again poor people paying to insulate the rich and the corporations from any loss. The U.S. government just set up what is known as a moral hazard.

After various allegations of barbarism made their way to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand, they ordered Francisco De Bobadilla to investigate the claims. His findings led to Columbus being stripped of his power as Governor and sent back to Spain in chains.

"Harriet Tubman monument unveiled, replacing Columbus statue in Newark, New Jersey","The irony is that Columbus Day itself was made a holiday to celebrate diversity and signify that Italians were finally accepted in America.

People seem to forget that the biggest lynching in US history was of a group of Italians in New Orleans, and that Italian Catholics were the KKKs number two enemy.

Though it may be worth mentioning that Columbus literally never stepped foot on land that is today part of the United States.. And really any descendants of tribes living within the US are attacking the wrong person..

 If you're Puerto Rican/Caribbean I understand hating Columbus, but if you're Lenape or Iroquois, etc, then you should be hating the Dutch/UK/US. Honestly an American flag should be far more offensive to those descendants than a statue of Columbus, but of course the land won't ever be returned so instead they turn to a symbolic ""victory"" over people who had nothing to do with their conquest..

That all being said, Columbus himself was not a morally good person that should be viewed as a role model. The obvious solution is to simply rename the holiday in honor of Amerigo Vespucci..

Except, of course, opposition to the holiday has nothing to do with Columbus himself but rather a hatred for Western Civilization. As evidenced by the holiday not being renamed but instead ""reclaimed"" 

I've said it before, but ""indigenous peoples day"" is the Left's version of confederate statues: pretend to celebrate historical enemies in order to antagonize present day political opponents.

But we have Genghis Khan, the Huns, the Viking hordes, the Barbary Pirates, the Ottomans, so many invaders…humans didn’t stay put. They traveled, they stole, conquered, pillaged, enslaved, and worse.

"Harriet Tubman monument unveiled, replacing Columbus statue in Newark, New Jersey","Why replace Columbus? Because of him America Canada, Mexico, all the countries in South America were  founded. It was the spark in which the new world was founded. That is one of the most significant events in history without it who knows how the world would be. You would land in a bunch of hypotheticals. While yes he was a controversial figure but guess what search hard enough and a lot of historical figures had flaws. Especially back centuries where a lot of things were seen as normal. I think trying to erase him and his discovery is ignorant and tarnishing history. 

People get their panties in a bunch about Columbus yet Che Guevara is viewed as a revolutionary hero which he killed way more people than Columbus did.",-3,0,16183,16183,,16183,tetrehedron,Picture-unrelated,0

U.S. officials weigh protecting all deposits at Silicon Valley Bank,"There appears to be a large misunderstanding by some users in this thread, SVB didn’t fail because of bad investments, they did have a poor mix of long-term vs. short-term assets, but the losses that were realized from the liquidation of part of those assets were not the main cause of SVB’s failure.

The bank experienced a bank run; $46 billion worth of deposits were withdrawn last week, which totaled almost 20% of all deposits held at the bank. That percentage of withdrawals would be untenable for almost any bank.

The cause of the run appears to be related to a mix of bad media coverage, poor asset management, the interest rate environment changing so rapidly, and provocative/irresponsible statements from media individuals.

And given only 2.7% of all deposits were covered by the FDIC, allowing the other 97.3% deposits to disappear would likely cause many multiples of worse harm than retroactively insuring those deposits.

So either the FDIC, which is NOT funded by the government, extends coverage to the uninsured deposits, or we begin seeing the tech sector of California, already being squeezed by the competitive environment, face mass layoffs due to not being able to make payroll, stunting local growth for years to come.

It’s a no-brainer guys: let the FDIC use private funds gotten from banks to insure all deposits for SVB and improve regulation going forward.",37,0,497,497,,497,Stayvfraw,AskMeAnythingIAnswer,0

The argument then is ""you didn't do your due diligence"" - rhey took the risk and lost. This isn't any different, only different in the demographics of who's affected.

‘It’s hard to focus’: Schools say American kids are hungry,30 years ago my mom was a nutritionist. She was a guest speaker each semester at the local university's teaching program.

The after school program (free) gave students a snack and dinner.  We had a backpack program where kids who needed it would take a backpack of food home on the weekends.

‘It’s hard to focus’: Schools say American kids are hungry,"When I was a kid we often didn’t have enough to eat at home and i remember not being able to think about anything but food.

After awhile the feeling stops and you get tired.

My brother was hospitalized for malnutrition a few times and he would get sores on his body and be weak from
It. No kid should have to deal with that.

Having gone through that im happy to pay taxes to ensure all kids get meals at school. I suffered, I’d never want others to feel that way too. Even if some wealthier kids benefit from it, whatever. They’re kids. They should get food.

Ps my brother is 33 and can’t read beyond basic words and I often wonder how much his health and not having food contributed.",395,0,8790,8790,,8790,moody4foody,AFaceForRadio_20,0

At my school, if the kids are hungry it’s because they either don’t want to eat the food we provide because “it’s nasty” or it’s haram, and they can’t eat it for religious preferences. 

Very few bring lunch and the ones that do also stress me out, because it consists of a bag of Takis and a soda.

‘It’s hard to focus’: Schools say American kids are hungry,"I worked in a school in Houston where almost all kids were eligible for free lunch. With that said... many kids were not signed up for free lunch because their parents were undocumented and were hard to communicate with (we had volunteer groups helping--- but there was a lack of trust about filling out any documents), and in some cases kids case the parents were just not actively paying attention to anything in that child's life--- either because they were just working multiple jobs to survive, or maybe a parent was dying and the kids were basically taking care of the younger kids, or commonly in our area they were on drugs and were just not there.   


As teachers every breakfast we would collect all unopened food and give it to the kids who had no food--- same for lunch. This was definitely against the the rules and we were reminded by administration to make sure all food was thrown in the trash because parents might be angry if we were feeding their kids without their permission, but when some of the kids had visible protruding ribs and slept all day because of both hunger and anxiety of course we're going to make sure get them what they needed. Fruit like apples and bananas were great as they would last longer---- you save those up and fill up the  backpacks of kids in the worst circumstances on Friday before the weekend so they have something to eat on Saturday/Sunday.   


One of the teachers actually moved to a house on the road in front of the school and basically told her students that if they were ever hungry during break or if there was ever an emergency they could come to her house and she'd figure it out --- she basically became a community mom spending any extra money on those kids and actively created a good report with all the parents to make it clear she wasn't there as a threat- but to support the kids as much as she could.  I should note that our school pay so low that just finding teachers to work at this school was nearly impossible. I was a teacher's assistant and was being paid minimum wage (Like $7.75 at the time). If there were unpaid lunch bills accumulating it basically became our responsibility to pay it---- the administration would send out emails saying they would start firing TAs if the bills were not paid so what choice did we have.  I should also note that they were paying minimum wage while having me do jobs that were certainly higher paying jobs I was not qualified for- like being a substitute teacher- often times for the preschool by myself, for Spanish speaking classes (I speak English only), and for the Special Education class by myself. 

I'm not complaining on behalf of myself although as a more experienced person I know I should have spoke up at the time.... I'm just trying to make the point that these schools are broke to the point they are staying afloat by hiring the least qualified, breaking rules meant to insure good quality education and child safety, and leaving the schools to physically fall apart being filled with cockroaches, mold, and just constantly smelling of urine because the plumbing doesn't work. Making sure kids had food was a very low priority... they don't care if they don't have food--- and they certainly don't care if your child is sick or needs resources because they're further behind or child safety and bullying. All that matters is that your kid physically shows up in school everyday because that's where the money comes from--- and if they don't- be warned that the school will try to get the law involved as soon as possible... not because they care about the child's wellbeing, but because they feel like you're stealing their money keeping your kid home even if they're vomiting their guts up. And all this is going on while another school on the other side of the highway where the rich kids live have the best teachers and best facilities and extra resources to provide kids both care and so many extra things that would just make kids WANT to learn and be at school.   


Probably not every school is this bad... but the experience I faced in those 3 years was bad enough that I just had no desire to to stay in education. I feel like dogs in the pound were treated more like living breathing things deserving of care and protection more than kids in a school.",443,0,8790,8790,,8790,Bluesnow2222,AFaceForRadio_20,0

I am STILL super grateful to be able to take advantage of that… We need to do more for these kids, there is no reason to punish children for the “sins” of their parents. 

Honestly, what do you want the kids to do? Give mom and dad a crash course on financial literacy? I certainly wasn’t going to tell my parents to pick themselves up by the bootstraps and figure their shit out… I was 14, living in horrible conditions, with some spiteful, recently divorced, drug addicted parents, who didn’t have an idea of what was going on in our lives. They didn’t really care. I was shouldering way bigger problems than I should have had at that age.

‘It’s hard to focus’: Schools say American kids are hungry,"As someone who grew up poor, I can attest to this.

Eating junk or often nothing at all, I was always tired. Often putting my head down and dozing off during class. No energy, always in a bad mood and couldn't focus or retain anything that was taught that day. I wasn't ""stupid"" but rather unable to really pay attention during the day due to lack of proper nutrition. 

Sure, there was free breakfast or lunch as a kid which helped. But, middle school and high school were different. You'd be teased and bullied for eating the free lunch, so many kids didn't eat because of this, myself included. 

I didn't do well in highschool at all and eventually dropped out.

But as I got older, I went to college and was able to eat regularly, doing much better in school. 

An adult who is away from home for work during the day has to eat to function. They buy lunch or bring something from home. Why should a child who is also away from home for 6-8 hours not be able to eat? Because they can't afford to buy food at school or bring food from home due to being poor?

I also have OCD, so I struggled with the thought of touching food in public and using public restrooms to clean my hands so for me eating at school was like a burden as crazy as that sounds. I got through school, but I was consumed by brain fog which not only affected how much I could pay attention in class, but also how I was socially. I had no energy all morning and afternoon. My parents really didn't do a great job of making sure I was eating, not that they were bad people.

"Insurers slashed Hurricane Ian payouts far below damage estimates, documents and insiders reveal","Going to give a nuanced take on it, but want to preface by plainly saying insurers taking advantage of people is wrong. 

First, if the insurers did something wrong they will get hammered in Florida. It's hard to get away with systematic failures anywhere much less Florida.

Second, Florida has so much fraud and grift taking advantage of the insurers (and as an extension policyholder and homeowners) that I would always take anything that comes out against insurers in FL with a grain of salt until all the facts are known.

Last, it's perfectly normal for the independent adjuster's estimates to be revised and claims to be denied even after they are estimated. The independent adjuster's don't make the coverage decisions ultimately (they don't usually see the full policy language) and they themselves have some incentive to write larger estimates (they are often paid based on how much they write for - the idea being a larger estimates takes more of their time).
This process is supposed to above board though. If the independent adjuster writes Wind damage the desk adjuster can't go erase that. The desk adjuster can disagree with their assessment but in practice they rarely do because if the coverage is disputed it's very simple for the insured to say ""even your own independent adjuster said it was wind damage!"". That is probably why in the article you see them telling independent adjuster's not say if something is wind damage - because the Insurer is wanting the final say on that. Which itself is not inherently wrong, but I wouldn't do that because who is going to be a better judge of wind damage, someone on the roof or someone looking at pictures 1,000 miles away?

Air Force pilot among 1st to fly supersonic plane while pregnant,"- An Air Force pilot has made history by becoming one of the first Air Force service members to fly a supersonic aircraft while pregnant. 

- Maj Lauren Olme, assistant director of operations for the 77th Weapons Squadron at Dyess Air Force Base near Abilene, Texas, flew a B-1 Lancer, a supersonic bomber. Olme's child has also become ""one of the first babies in the Department of Defense to clock 9.2 hours in a supersonic aircraft,"" according to an Air Force press release.

- ""I can't overexpress how amazing it is that pregnant women now have the opportunity to fly in all types of aircraft,"" Lauren Olme said in a statement. ""It's a very personal decision that [my husband] Mark and I made together because there are risks involved in flying the B-1 while pregnant but after conferring with Air Force and civilian medical doctors, we felt comfortable with me flying for a few weeks.""

- The Air Force clarified its policy last year and removed some restrictions for pregnant Air Force members. Air Force members can now ""voluntarily request to fly during pregnancy"" and do not need a waiver ""to fly in the second trimester with an uncomplicated pregnancy in a non-ejection seat aircraft if all flight safety criteria are met.""

- ""All pregnant aircrew are authorized to apply for a waiver regardless of trimester, aircraft or flight profile,"" the Air Force stated in an April 2022 news release.

- ""These changes are a significant step in the right direction to empowering every member of our team to serve to their full potential,"" Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said in a statement at the time. ""The Department of the Air Force’s most important asset is our people. We are focused on eliminating barriers that hamper the ability to attract and retain the most talented individuals who want to serve.""",13,0,168,168,,168,SunCloud-777,SunCloud-777,0

Paul Flores sentenced to 25 years to life for 1996 murder of Kristin Smart,"Been following this case for a long time since it happened in my own backyard. Paul Flores is undoubtedly beyond a POS but the whole case seemed pretty circumstantial, at least the way Chris Lambert portrayed it. I enjoyed the podcast and thought Lambert did phenomenally well making his case but it became more and more obvious that Lambert had developed a vendetta by the in-court episodes.

Obviously I wasn’t on the jury to see the evidence but in the end I don’t think conviction was justified. Flores was probably guilty but that’s a far cry from beyond a reasonable doubt",-12,0,1318,1318,,1318,jonestown_manicure,Tsquare43,0

Secretary of Defense orders on-site evaluations of military academies after report reveals increase in sexual assaults among students,"This is something that needed to be done years ago for far more than just the military academies. The issue of sexual assault in the military (of both women and men) has been discussed and brought up for decades now. 

And the culture of our military units directly promotes it, with boot camp instructors even telling women that they should expect to be raped. 

There are no real protections or even reporting systems in place. Those systems that claim to exist ultimately do nothing in most cases unless the victims manage to get media exposure and pressure on their case. 

The first minimum step that could be taken to try and fix this is to remove the legal cases from being in control by the military. Military tribunals and the internal military structure **should not** be in charge of these cases, because they generally try to bury them.",70,0,895,895,,895,Silverseren,Dirty_Quesadilla,0

Roku says 26% of its cash reserves are stuck in Silicon Valley Bank,"Explainer on the fall of the Silicon Valley Bank, which fell due to a classic ""run on the bank"" as startups were forced this last 10 days to take large chunks of  their money out in a short-time: 

'As higher interest rates caused the market for initial public offerings to shut down for many startups and made private fundraising more costly, some Silicon Valley Bank clients started pulling money out to meet their liquidity needs. This culminated in Silicon Valley Bank looking for ways this week to meet its customers' withdrawals.'

So the bank had to sell assets to come up with cash the startups wanted to withdraw. But its assets weren't worth enough:

""To fund the redemptions, Silicon Valley Bank sold on Wednesday a $21 billion bond portfolio consisting mostly of U.S. Treasuries. The portfolio was yielding it an average 1.79%, far below the current 10-year Treasury yield of around 3.9%. This forced SVB to recognize a $1.8 billion loss, which it needed to fill through a capital raise.""

To raise the capital to cover the shortfall, it decided to sell some stock:

""SVB announced on Thursday it would sell $2.25 billion in common equity and preferred convertible stock to fill its funding hole. Its shares ended trading on the day down 60%, as investors fretted that the deposit withdrawals may push it to raise even more capital.""

Oops. No one believed the bank could stop the rapid withdrawals & people also stopped trusting the bank generally. 

Trust is everything to a bank, and without trust, the panic grew.

So more companies rushed to withdraw & seeing withdrawals accelerate, it started to look like a death spiral to investors. 

The panic spread; no one wanted to buy any stock:

""Some SVB clients pulled their money from the bank on the advice of venture capital firms such as Peter Thiel's Future Fund, Reuters reported. This spooked investors such as General Atlantic that SVB had lined up for the stock sale, and the capital raising effort collapsed late on Thursday.""

Boom. The end game: 

""SVB scrambled on Friday to find alternative funding, including through a sale of the company.""

But no one wants to buy a bank they don't trust & is manifestly collapsing in front of their eyes: 

""Later in the day, however, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) then announced that SVB was shut down and placed under its receivership.""

Roku says 26% of its cash reserves are stuck in Silicon Valley Bank,"Fun fact! Venture capital in the US is run by morons that don't or rarely use common analytic tools standard in other countries:

> The decision process to fund a company is elusive. One study report in the Harvard Business Review[44] states that VCs rarely use standard financial analytics.[44] First, VCs engage in a process known as ""generating deal flow,"" where they reach out to their network to source potential investments.[44] The study also reported that few VCs use any type of financial analytics when they assess deals; VCs are primarily concerned about the cash returned from the deal as a multiple of the cash invested.[44]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital#Structure_of_the_funds

So, SVB's heavy investment in venture capital should have induced caution in rational investors. This, coupled with their status as a commercial bank (ha! wtf is glass-Steagall?!), means they were exposed to a large amount of risk. But, since rich people are just smarter than most people, they obviously must have known better than the mooks who didn't invest!

> The company focused on lending to technology companies, providing multiple services to venture capital, revenue-based financing and private equity firms that invest in technology and biotechnology, and also on private banking services for high-net-worth individuals, in its home market in Silicon Valley.[1][7][8] In addition to taking deposits and making loans, the bank operated venture capital and private equity divisions that sometimes invested in the firm's commercial banking clients.[9]

Circle assures market after stablecoin USDC breaks dollar peg,"What strong assurance! ""It'll be ok guys we promise""",15,0,100,100,,100,SubstanceAltered,Dirty_Quesadilla,0
Circle assures market after stablecoin USDC breaks dollar peg,"LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - Stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) lost its dollar peg and slumped to an all-time low on Saturday before recovering most of its losses after Circle, the firm behind it, assured investors it would honor the peg despite exposure to failed Silicon Valley Bank.

Circle said in a tweet on Friday it has $3.3 billion of its $40 billion of USDC reserves at Silicon Valley Bank. On Saturday, the cryptocurrency company said in a blog post that USDC liquidity operations will resume as normal when banks open on Monday morning in the United States.

""As a regulated payment token, USDC will remain redeemable 1 for 1 with the U.S. Dollar"", the company said in a blog post.

The cryptocurrency firm said that in the event the bank does not return 100% of deposits, it will cover any shortfall using corporate resources, involving external capital if necessary.

The coin, which broke its 1:1 dollar peg and fell as low as $0.88 shortly after 0800 GMT (3 a.m. EST) on Saturday, according to market tracker CoinGecko, recovered to trade around $0.97 by 2100 GMT.

Silicon Valley Bank collapsed on Friday in the largest U.S. bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis, roiling global markets and stranding billions of dollars belonging to companies and investors.

Circle said in a tweet on Friday that the company and USDC ""continue to operate normally"" while the firm waits for clarity on what will happen to Silicon Valley Bank depositors.

Meanwhile, U.S. crypto exchange Coinbr said in a tweet it was not allowing USDC to be exchanged for U.S. dollars over the weekend while banks are closed, citing ""heightened activity"", while it plans to resume swaps on Monday.

Joseph Edwards, investment advisor at Enigma Securities, said the situation was ""extremely serious"" for USDC.

""No matter how sound Circle's operations are, this sort of depeg on a stablecoin tends to fundamentally undermine confidence in it,"" Edwards said.

""The short-term implications here are dramatic and unknowable, especially once systems start to have to be adjusted to the reality that 1 USDC isn't trading at 1 USD for the time being.""

CONSTANT EXCHANGE RATE

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a constant exchange rate with ""fiat"" currencies - those backed by a central government rather than a physical commodity such as gold - for example through a 1:1 U.S. dollar peg.

Used in cryptocurrency trading, they have surged in value in recent years. USDC is the second-biggest stablecoin with a market cap of $37 billion. The largest, Tether, has a market cap of $72 billion, according to CoinGecko.

USDC's price usually holds close to $1, making Saturday's drop unprecedented. According to CoinGecko data, its previous all-time low was around $0.97 in 2018, though in 2022 it fell just below $0.99 when cryptocurrency markets were roiled by the collapse of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.

Traders have been on guard this week for signs of contagion in the financial sector and beyond from troubles for Silicon Valley Bank and crypto-focused Silvergate (SI.N), which this week disclosed plans to wind down operations and voluntarily liquidate.

Boston-brd Circle said last week it had moved a ""small percentage"" of USDC reserve deposits held at Silvergate to its other banking partners.

The chief executive of cryptocurrency exchange Binance said in a tweet on Friday it had no exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, as did Tether Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino.

Stablecoin issuer Paxos and crypto exchange Gemini also tweeted that they do not have relationships with the bank.

Apparently they had to get through 2 ""checkpoints"" controlled by the cartel once inside Mexico and pay them money. He said if he took a woman with him, they would kill him and we'd never see her again.  Our remaining CPAs refused to go there anymore.  Management had a fit.

Despite efforts to address the issue, it seems to be getting worse. Sadly, this is the result of the human trafficking network's operations.

The number of missing women in Mexico is difficult to determine with precision because of factors such as underreporting, lack of reliable data, and corruption. However, according to official figures, there were more than 79,000 people missing in Mexico as of March 2021, with many of them presumed to be victims of violence or forced disappearance. While men and boys account for the majority of these cases, women and girls are disproportionately affected, with estimates ranging from several thousand to tens of thousands of missing women in Mexico.

Rupert Murdoch: Fox News fired Kimberly Guilfoyle for ‘inappropriate behavior’,"Full Text:

> After Kimberly Guilfoyle mysteriously left Fox News in the summer of 2018, she found herself vehemently denying news reports that said her departure was due to allegations of sexually inappropriate behavior.
> 
> But her former boss, Fox News Chairman Rupert Murdoch, has apparently confirmed that he wanted her gone because of the allegations, which were detailed in a 2020 report in The New Yorker. Murdoch’s concerns about Guifoyle, a former top campaign aide for Trump, were revealed in a trove of texts and emails that were recently leaked in Dominion Voting Systems’ lawsuit against Fox News.
> 
> Murdoch said in an email, sent in the wake of the 2020 election, that he had “insisted” Fox News fire Guilfoyle “for inappropriate behavior.” The 91-year-old executive also ripped into his once-popular Fox News host in other ways, according to the email, which was shared by Semafor media reporter Max Tani.
> 
> While Murdoch’s note mistakenly called Guilfoyle “Kimberly Strassel,” an opinion writer for the Wall Street Journal, he clearly was referring to Guilfoyle when he wrote about her association with Newsmax. The rival news network was known for pushing even harder than Fox News to promote debunked conspiracy theories that Donald Trump’s loss to Joe Biden was due to widespread election fraud.
> 
> “Newsmax not good people!” Rupert wrote in the email. “Being advised by Don jr’s girlfriend Kimberley Strassel who I insisted we fire for inappropriate behavior. Not one of our people will join her. Newsmax desperate for money. Scoured the world, so far without luck.”
> 
> It’s clear that Murdoch is talking about Guilfoyle, given his reference to “Don Jr.’s girlfriend” and her being “fired”; Strassel still writes for the Wall Street Journal. Guilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr. have been dating since 2018 and became a popular duo in MAGA circles, campaigning for Trump’s re-election in 2020 and helping him to push his lies that the election was stolen. Both also spoke at Trump’s Jan. 6 rally, which preceded the violent attack at the U.S. Capitol to stop congress from certifying the results of the election.
> 
> After her departure from Fox, Guilfoyle became a contributor to Newsmax. Along with One American News Network, Newsmax aggressively pushed false claims of voter fraud. In its lawsuit, Dominion alleges that Fox News hosts and executives harbored doubts about such claims but promoted them anyway because they worried about losing audience to Newsmax or OAN.
> 
> The idea that Murdoch wanted Guilfoyle gone adds weight to the New Yorker report, published a month before the 2020 election. The report suggested that Guilfoyle had to leave Fox News, where she had worked since the mid-2000s, because of sexual harassment allegations made by a former assistant. Before the New Yorker report, the popular explanation for Guilfoyle’s departure from Fox was that she wanted to avoid conflicts of interest posed by her new romance with Trump Jr.
> 
> Reporter Jane Mayer detailed allegations in a 42-page draft complaint, which said that **Guilfoyle showed lewd photos of male genitalia to colleagues, regularly discussed sexual matters at work, urged the assistant “to submit to a Fox employee’s demands for sexual favors,” and exposed herself to the assistant while asking for a critique of her naked body.**
> 
> The story furthermore described efforts by Guilfoyle to cover up the allegations, citing well-informed sources who said the network paid the former assistant up to $4 million to avoid a trial.
> 
> In her response to the New Yorker report, Guilfoyle referred to her time as a prosecutor in San Francisco in the early 2000s, before and during her marriage to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was then mayor of San Francisco.
> 
> “In my 30-year career working for the SF District Attorney’s Office, the LA District Attorney’s Office, in media and in politics, I have never engaged in any workplace misconduct of any kind,” she said in a statement.
> 
> In a recent interview with CNN’s Axe Files podcast, Newsom opened up for the first time about his political differences with Guilfoyle, his wife from 2001 to 2006. He said she was a “different person” back when they were married and that she ended up becoming a right-wing personality because “she fell prey” to the culture at Fox News after she began working there in 2006.",562,0,7489,7489,,7489,GonzoVeritas,GonzoVeritas,0

It's more appropriate for communist dictatorships than for a free country such as ours. Neither the pledges or national anthems should be an everyday event mandated by law in schools.

Yes, it makes some people warm around heart, makes them feel woke if you will, to see small children recite patriotic phrases... even though they are way too young to understand their meaning. If you are a patriot, you are no less an patriot if you never recited the pledge in your life. If you are not patriot at heart, reciting it isn't going to make you into one.

FWIW. In theory, it is technically not mandatory that students must participate in these (there's already a ruling on that). That is why the state law in South Carolina doesn't require everybody to participate as such. But in practice, it opens a door for anybody not participating to be bullied, ostracized, or both. Either by staff (as was the case here), or by other students. Making the distinction that it is technically ""not"" mandatory a very moot point.

9th grader sues over Pledge of Allegiance confrontation,"[The pledge of allegiance](https://www.ushistory.org/documents/pledge.htm)

The Pledge of Allegiance

The Pledge of Allegiance was written in August 1892 by the socialist minister Francis Bellamy (1855-1931). It was originally published in The Youth's Companion on September 8, 1892. Bellamy had hoped that the pledge would be used by citizens in any country.

In its original form it read:

    ""I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.""

In 1923, the words, ""the Flag of the United States of America"" were added. At this time it read:

    ""I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.""

In 1954, in response to the Communist threat of the times, President Eisenhower encouraged Congress to add the words ""under God,"" creating the 31-word pledge we say today. Bellamy's daughter objected to this alteration. Today it reads:

    ""I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.""

Section 4 of the Flag Code states:

    The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag: ""I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."", should be rendered by standing at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. When not in uniform men should remove any non-religious headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Persons in uniform should remain silent, face the flag, and render the military salute.""

The original Bellamy salute, first described in 1892 by Francis Bellamy, who authored the original Pledge, began with a military salute, and after reciting the words ""to the flag,"" the arm was extended toward the flag.

    At a signal from the Principal the pupils, in ordered ranks, hands to the side, face the Flag. Another signal is given; every pupil gives the flag the military salute — right hand lifted, palm downward, to a line with the forehead and close to it. Standing thus, all repeat together, slowly, ""I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands; one Nation indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all."" At the words, ""to my Flag,"" the right hand is extended gracefully, palm upward, toward the Flag, and remains in this gesture till the end of the affirmation; whereupon all hands immediately drop to the side.

    The Youth's Companion, 1892

"Kiska, sometimes know as the world’s loneliest orca, has died at Marineland","final release

Newsweek, 8/18/22

Harrowing footage shows a lonely killer whale circling its tank and thrashing around, having outlived its friends and offspring.

Kiska, dubbed the ""world's loneliest orca,"" circled the perimeter and splashed water over the walls of her isolated tank at MarineLand Park in Niagra Falls, Ontario, Canada. The footage was filmed in June 2022.

The orca is said to have been captured in Icelandic waters in 1979, and has been in captivity ever since. Kiska, who is approximately 45-years-old, has survived all of her tank mates and her five calves, activists say.

Researchers and activists believe her behavior is a result of her damaged mental and physical health and well-being from prolonged captivity. SWNS reached out to MarineLand Park for comment.

MarineLand has had 26 orcas pass through its tanks since it opened in 1962, with 20 of them dying there and the rest either traded or given away to other establishments.

Despite being well-known as social animals that thrive in groups, Kiska remains isolated from any other animal.

Former MarineLand employee-turned-activist Phil Demers, 44, who worked at the park for 12 years, said: ""Kiska is MarineLand's last surviving orca. She was captured in 1979 in Icelandic waters and has been at MarineLand ever since.

""Her mental and physical health are deteriorating and as seen in the video, she repeatedly swims around her pool in the exact same way, even stopping briefly in some shallow water to shake erratically.

""Experts call it ""zoochosis."" Orcas are social animals and need to be with their families, or at the least, with others of their own species. For Kiska, her isolation is torture. Sadly, Kiska's fate is largely sealed at MarineLand as she is their property, and as no viable seaside sanctuaries exist, her future is heartbreakingly bleak.""",372,0,2096,2096,,2096,kstinfo,waitingforthesun92,0

One pool did not allow any bathing suits in the water because it is easier to clean.  Shower first.  And cover up on the way to the water if you want.  Most did not.  Towels and clothes at the edge of the pool get wet. 

Another place had shower rooms next to the rest rooms.  Ladies to the left and men to the right .  The showers were all being used, so I went around the corner to the second shower room.

"After teen’s death, schools rethink sending children out of state to Diamond Ranch Academy","(Copied from previous posts on r/TroubledTeens )

Reddit can visit r/troubledteens to read more horrific testimonials and about families left broken by this (primarily) Mormon-run **Kids For Cash** machine that is Utah/Idaho/Washington/Oregon’s “Trouble Teen” industry. 

This whole grift is essentially just a legalized form of **Kids 4 Cash** and the center owners & therapists at these programs **own financial stakes in multiple lock-down treatment, outpatient, and wilderness programs.** They make a percentage of enrollment profits by filling and even over-filling these programs, even by placing teens in programs run by completely different therapists, well beyond their normal operating jurisdictions. They only care about a full-fill capacity and their bottom line, not who is in their program and what irreparable personal and intrafamilial damage it causes. There is no vetting process for enrollment and these Mormons genuinely believe every single person can benefit from their forced lifestyles- every teen sent is considered “acceptable.” No one is rejected, and the vast majority are not criminals and have no criminal history whatsoever— they’re just not 18 yet. They will, however, *both threaten* *and proceed* with trying to extend a captive’s minorship-status past 18 by legal means for those who do reach legal adulthood while held captive unwillingly. 

There is so much rampant physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and entirely unsympathetic to antagonistic to even sociopathic staff members who are **more than willing** to physically harm teens who simply say “I refuse” to an unreasonable command. Further, many programs even rent the kids out for labor purposes; it’s not uncommon to see them building trails or working on beautifying highways. 

Many centers (like Solstice Treatment Center) create fake reviews on Google- reposting the same text about “the program being great help” using multiple fake names that no one who was actually  in the program could recall. The r/TroubledTeens industry literally force-feeds enrollment lies and bullshit to families looking for genuine help. It is essentially a back-door form of false advertisement. Just like the entire r/troubledteens industry is a back-door Mormon-run Kids 4 Cash scheme.

A not insignificant portion of teens sent to these programs are queer or questioning youth from families that use these Mormons as a back-door form of conversion therapy. On top of that a not inconsiderable portion are there because their parents are truly pieces of shit and they’ve really been horribly abused; I’ve seen people sent to these programs for turning in their parents for committing crimes. I know someone who was sent to Utah because their mother found out they were testifying against them in court. Another person who filed a false police report under duress to cover for his abusive parents was abducted after telling the truth to school educators and the police.

Probably most significant is that a huge portion of teens sent to these programs **permanently cut contact** from their families afterwards, or, at the very least report the ability to trust and hold any sort of meaningful relationship with their parent/guardian is irreparable and never coming back. Compare this to the therapists and enrollment staff selling parents a bullshit flowery picture of “what could be” and you’ll start to realize how insidious and deranged this whole industry actually is.

Follow the cash- this is **MORMON KIDS FOR CASH** Entire townships are in on the grift.

Also- there was recently a case where a legally emancipated teen (abusive parents, namely the mother) was abducted by the therapy goon squad and taken to a lock-down center where he was held until pressure forced the center to relinquish his wrongful imprisonment/kidnapping. These Mormons do not give a fuck about who is sent to them, just that more keep coming.

Edit: To any parent reading this thinking of sending your kid to one of these programs, know there’s a very good chance they’re going to abandon you in adulthood, and **you will absolutely deserve it** for what you’re about to put them through.",100,0,3695,3695,,3695,Piperplays,ninjascotsman,0

 - He pleaded guilty immediately.    

TL;DR: Burning a cross is a symbol, other symbols could have resulted in similar consequences (e.g. wearing a Klan hood, a cardboard sign calling them a racist name). Combined with other facts and maybe their own statements, violating the Fair Housing Act was handed to prosecutors on a silver platter. You can burn your own property, but if you're doing so to ""send a message"" then you may violate a law.",464,0,1240,1240,,1240,TimeRemove,jeetah,0
Mississippi man gets 42 months in prison for cross burning,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A Mississippi man who burned a cross in his front yard to intimidate his Black neighbors was sentenced Thursday to 42 months in prison.

Cox, of Gulfport, was charged with violating the Fair Housing Act over a December 2020 incident in which he put together a wooden cross in his front yard and propped it up so his Black neighbors could see it. He then doused it with motor oil and lit it on fire. He also addressed the family with racially derogatory language, records say.

“This cross burning was an abhorrent act that used a traditional symbol of hatred and violence to stoke fear and drive a Black family out of their home,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.",102,0,1240,1240,,1240,StrawberryLemonMoon,jeetah,0

Artificial turf potentially linked to cancer deaths of six Phillies ball players – report | Cancer,"This seems like a tenuous link at best. I don't like artificial turf for a number of reasons but there are many potential sources for dangerous chemicals, it seems to be quite the leap to go straight to artificial turf as the source of these cancers. Maybe there was something in the water, maybe it was where they were housed, maybe the locker rooms or offices had toxins in them.

A true study would look at everyone involved, from groundskeepers to executives, and see if there are any trends in the cancers. For example, you'd expect groundskeepers who regularly handle and maintain the artificial turf to show a similar spike. The same goes for people who make and install the stuff. If you see a spike in the workers who clean the locker rooms then you can look there for the causes.

No doubt that manufacturers have to do better with these materials, making sure that they are as low in dangerous compounds as possible. However, we shouldn't jump straight to one material as the cause without fully understanding all possible causes.

>SK on is helping build a new generation of mobility that will create cleaner, more convenient forms of transportation

Right on (heh).  

>Parent organization: SK Innovation Co

Hm, lets go there!

>SK innovation is an energy and chemical company, independently pursuing batteries and oil exploration and production (E&P) businesses through eight subsidiaries: SK energy, SK global chemical, SK lubricants, SK incheon petrochem, SK trading international, SK ie technology, SK on, and SK earthon. SK innovation became the first company in Korea to secure overseas oil fields with the successful exploration in Marib, North Yemen, in 1984. Ever since, the company has had huge success in Vietnam and the U.S., and is contributing to resource-lacking nations' energy security and economic development. As of the end of March 2020, the company operates 13 oil fields and four liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in eight countries; the major fields produced, on average, 48,000 barrels per day.

>SK innovation also supplies high-energy-density batteries for global automakers' electric vehicles (EVs), and is continuing innovative R&D to meet the rising demand for EVs and changing technology trends. As of early 2020, the company achieved an annual production capacity of approximately 20 GWh across Korea, Hungary, and China.

It made a deep impression on me. I think I was 14 at the time. I never knew that there were German people who hated the Nazi regime as much as people outside of Germany, and that they organized a resistance as well.

I think it's important to know that. An entire country did NOT just go along with mass genocide and shrug it off. Brave, brave individuals (kids, really, now that I'm older) resisted what they saw as injustice and horrific actions from their own people.

I gladly work through everyone’s day, interests, issues, needs, we eat dinner with no complaints or screaming from any misunderstandings or shenanigans from the dogs, me and my wife spontaneously orgasm from finally having a day where no one loses their shit and everyone listens thoughtfully before asking something of someone.

Ukrainians who fled war face end of temporary US sanctuary,"SAN DIEGO — When U.S. officials at the U.S.-Mexico border stamped the Ukrainian passports of Mariia and her daughter last April and gave them permission to stay for a year, she figured she would return home within months.

Now with that year almost up and the war that caused them to flee still raging, their permission to stay in the U.S. — known as humanitarian parole — is set to expire April 23.

“The word `worry’ doesn’t capture what I’m feeling,” said Mariia, who spoke through an interpreter and asked that only her first name be used over concerns that speaking publicly would hurt their immigration case. “This is something that frightens me, mainly because of my daughter and my daughter’s future.”

The 46-year-old woman and her daughter, now 13, are among 20,000 Ukrainians in a similar situation, according to resettlement agencies. Most arrived to the United States at its southern border after fleeing to Mexico, where it was easier and faster to get a visa to enter the country in the first months following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Mariia’s parole is tied to her work permit, enabling her to earn a living as a nanny, and makes her eligible for food stamps and other public assistance. Her husband flew to the U.S. to join them in July and received humanitarian parole for two years.

The Biden administration has said it is working on a fix but so far has issued no official guidance on what Ukrainians should do, according to advocates helping the Ukrainians. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment.

Jewish Federations of North America, which provided support for the agency that helped Mariia’s family get settled, is among the organizations that have written to the Biden administration to quickly renew humanitarian parole for Ukrainians.

Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, the CEO of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said people are scrambling to figure out what to do. One option would be to apply for asylum, but a war doesn’t necessarily qualify someone for that.

“Even short-term solutions like individual parole extensions are unclear since there’s no uniform guidance, which leads to delays and confusion,” she said.

Some Ukrainians have considered returning to the U.S. border crossings where they entered to ask for an extension, but that leaves the decision up to the port director, O’Mara Vignarajah said. It can also be expensive to travel and requires time off work, advocates said.

Some have been told by officials to write across the top of the government’s parole form “Re-Parole,” since there is no option to check for an extension, according to advocates.

“It highlights how ad hoc the process is,” O’Mara Vignarajah said. “These requests often go unanswered or are transferred to different agencies, and because there is no clear process in how to handle them, sometimes they are simply denied.”

The government turned to humanitarian parole as a quick fix to deal with the fallout from the many world crises that have occurred as the U.S. refugee system that was dismantled by the previous administration was being built back up. Now numerous groups are facing their permission to remain in the United States expiring in coming months, including tens of thousands of Afghans.

“Humanitarian parole was never meant to be over relied on at the expense of refugee resettlement or asylum protections,” said Meredith Owen of Church World Service.

Liliia Lukianchuk, a Ukrainian mother of four, has applied for asylum with the help of Lutheran Social Services, but she and her husband have not gotten an answer. Their parole expires April 16, and it is tied to her husband’s mechanic job in Jacksonville, Florida, where they live. She fears that if they’re sent back, her 17-year-old son will end up on the front lines as a solider.

“Of course, I’m worried because the worst-case scenario would be to be returned to Ukraine, but I have to be strong for my family,” she said through an interpreter.

Mariia and her daughter arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border after trying to settle in four different countries. The lines at Poland’s border were too long. In Hungary, they could find a hotel room for only one night at a time and were told by locals that the government was not in favor of hosting Ukrainians. They went on to Belgium, where many Ukrainians were arriving, but the local school had no room for her daughter. Then in Spain, they were told it would be difficult to find work and an apartment. That’s when Mariia decided to go to the United States and was told Mexico was the best way.

Jewish Family Services of Greenwich helped her find a job, enroll her daughter in school and get settled in Greenwich, Connecticut.

Mariia said only recently did she and her daughter start feeling hopeful about rebuilding their lives.

“To be honest, the first five months, my eyes to that were closed. My primary goal was to just make sure my child was OK, to calm her down and reassure her that she was safe,” she said.

Tania Priatka of Jewish Family Services said Mariia’s family is working with a lawyer who has advised them to wait for guidance from the government. If that doesn’t happen soon, they plan to go to the nearest airport and ask Customs and Border Protection officials there for help.

For now, Mariia tries to stay hopeful, but struggles when her daughter asks what will happen.

“I feel lost. I feel hopeless.” Mariia said, her voice shaking as she grew emotional. “As a mother, I should be able to give my child an answer that she will be well and that she will be safe.”",33,0,397,397,,397,pensivebadger,pensivebadger,0

Lurgan rape: Tanya Lord jailed for attack on sleeping man,">He said neither he, nor the prosecution, could find any similar case anywhere in the UK.

That's because for those of us who fell victim to this behaviour, we were laughed at or told we 'got lucky'.

One NYE, I had a friend over. I had zero sexual interest in her; not my type physically or emotionally. The last thing I remember of that night was remarking that my beer tasted funny.

I woke up in the morning to find us naked in bed together. I was really confused and she laughed saying ""Oh don't you remember last night?"". It turned out she'd been sneaking aftershock (a strong liquor) into my beers all night. I know we had sex because she phoned me the next week to advise that she'd given me chlamydia. Angry, I told her I'd never have slept with her if she hadn't spiked me; she said ""That was a hurtful thing to say"".

Have to say, when I've relayed this before on reddit everyone was very supportive. That's not the reaction I had IRL; I was mocked, belittled, told I must have wanted to fuck her else how did I get it up? She was quite overweight and for years I kept having this horrible 'wet nightmare' of a big blobby alien laying on top of me and raping me.

Looks like the person also issued the credit to their own personal CC then turned around and bought a Tesla and other high priced items. If they woulda kept it in believable amounts, didn’t flash the money around, and kept it off their own personal cards they might have gotten away with it. 

I worked in corporate IT at my companies HQ a while back. My office was right next to the head of internal legal or something like that. Basically his job was to deal with people charging personal expenses to their corporate CC; internal fraud stuff. I had water cooler talks with him in the hall and he would mention frequently it’s always the dumbest ones who do it and they always go all in. It’s never a few hundred here and there.

Black couple settles lawsuit claiming their home appraisal was lowballed due to bias,">The lender agreed to send a different appraiser.  
>  
>This time the couple decided to ""white wash"" the house. They removed family photos and art work, books, hair products and anything else that might indicate that a Black family lived there. They also asked a white friend to be present at the house and greet the appraiser as if she were the homeowner and to display some of her family photos in the house. The Austins were not at home during the appraisal.  
>  
>The new appraiser concluded the house was worth $1,482,500 – nearly half a million dollars higher than Miller's estimated value.

NASA is monitoring an asteroid that could collide with Earth on Valentine's Day in 2046,"Thanks for sharing! Here's a preview of the article: 

Out of the millions of asteroids in our solar system, there's a very small fraction known to potentially impact Earth. But scientists found a new one just two weeks ago that so far seems to pose one of the greatest risks of them all. 

The asteroid, known as 2023 DW, was only first discovered on Feb. 26, according to the European Space Agency. It's now been added to the agency's Risk List, a catalog of space objects that could potentially have some kind of impact on Earth, and because of what scientists have so far seen – it's ranking on the list is currently at No. 1.

But don't worry, that doesn't mean catastrophic damage is imminent.  

2023 DW has a Torino Scale ranking of 1, meaning that it's currently predicted to pose ""no unusual level of danger,"" according to the scale. Researchers believe that it has about a 50-meter diameter – about the length of an Olympic-sized swimming pool – but said that the ""size uncertainty could be large.""

Then a day or two later we got another talk about responsible drinking because it was put out he was like double the legal driving limit.

Then later we got another talk about respecting animals because someone happened to be filming on their cellphone before and during the gator attack.

Dude was yelling at the gator and smacking it in the head with a paddle for like five minutes because he wanted to see it move.

SoFi Bank sues to block Biden's student loan payment pause,"I had some private loans that I wanted to refinance with these guys because they typically offered better rates than most refi companies and my interest was 8% - 14% after the most recent hike (at the time) from the fed. They didn’t want me because my DTI was too high, which is fine - I ended up just wiping my savings out from my first big gig on the variable rate loans so now I’m only left with my fixed rate stuff and my federal loans.

I will say these guys were incredibly predatory, I just strictly wanted to refinance my private stuff, not the federal stuff and I was pressured not once but 3 times to do the whole lot. Something smells like they’re getting kickbacks from refinancing federal loans. 

Anyway now I receive emails about changes to banking and investment accounts I know for a fact I don’t have with the company. So I can only assume it’s just sloppy bulk emails being sent out.

Won’t do business with a company that can barely figure out how to sort their client pool in a reasonable way, and CERTAINLY won’t do business with a company preying on actual real people to refinance federal loans so they lose out on any benefit they would have received.

If you are here still reading this;
DO NOT.
And I mean DO NOT - refinance your federal loans.

Don’t even do it if you know your income will be consistent and you can pay it off in 4 years, because honestly? You don’t truly know that. We’re all one layoff wave away from losing a job.

Do not refinance your federal loan you will lose out on key protections such as income based repayment plans and forbearance. Private companies do not care what is going on in your life, they provide little to no help in these situations, and they will ruin your life to squeeze blood from a stone.

Do not refinance your federal loans, and if you must, don’t do it with SoFi :) they don’t need to purchase more stadiums with your hard earned money.",3,0,3243,3243,,3243,Camaendes,SpookyScaryySkeleton,0

Executive gets 15 months in prison in doomed nuclear project

A former executive utility who gave rosy projections on the progress of two nuclear power plants in South Carolina while they were hopelessly behind will spend 15 months in prison for the doomed project

ByJEFFREY COLLINS Associated Press
March 8, 2023, 1:52 PM

COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A former executive utility who gave rosy projections on the progress of two nuclear power plants in South Carolina while they were hopelessly behind will spend 15 months in prison for the doomed project that cost ratepayers billions of dollars.

Ex-SCANA Corp. Executive Vice President Stephen Byrne apologized in court Wednesday, saying he thinks about how he let down customers, shareholders, employees, taxpayers and his family almost every day.

The two nuclear plants, which never generated a watt of power despite $9 billion of investment, were supposed to be “the crowning achievement of my life,” Byrne said. “But I failed.”

Byrne is the second SCANA executive to head to prison for the nuclear debacle. Former CEO Kevin Marsh was sentenced to two years in prison in October 2021 and released earlier in March after serving about 17 months.

Two executives at Westinghouse, which was contracted to build the reactors, are also charged. Carl Churchman, who was the company's top official at the Fairfield County construction site at V.C. Summer, pleaded guilty to perjury and is awaiting sentencing. Former Westinghouse senior vice president Jeff Benjamin faces 16 charges. His trial is scheduled for October.

Both defense lawyers and prosecutors agreed to delay Byrne's prison sentence until he testifies at Benjamin's trial to make sure he is honest and helpful.

But that isn't in doubt. Prosecutors said Byrne was the first executive to come to investigators after the project was abandoned in July 2017. His careful notes taken in every meeting of who spoke and what was said saved the government years of work unraveling the lies, prosecutor Winston Holliday said.

“They are the handwriting of an engineer,"" Holliday said.

In all, Byrne met with state and federal agents 15 times, sometimes for entire days. He walked them through what happened from the 2008 proposal to build the plants that led to a state law allowing the utility to raise rates so much of the risk fell on customers, to the final desperate meetings in 2017 when it was obvious the project was dead.

His cooperation led U.S. District Judge Mary Geiger Lewis to agree with the defense and prosecution recommendation of a 15-month prison sentence, a $200,000 fine and $1 million in restitution. Federal sentencing guidelines suggest a maximum five-year sentence for conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.

Byrne, 63, told state regulators in 2016 that construction of the plants would finish in time to get more than $1 billion in tax credits vital for SCANA and its subsidiary South Carolina Electric & Gas to afford the project. The goal was to reassure shareholders and others that the project, which leaders knew was hopelessly delayed and over budget, was on track.

But unlike other executives, whose sin was greed and wanting to line their own pockets with bonuses, Holliday said Byrne's sin appeared to be pride.

“I genuinely believe as an engineer he wanted to build this thing,"" Holliday said.

The first words Byrne said in court were “I'm sorry.” He has been a nuclear engineer all his life and said he regrets the role he played in stifling the growth of nuclear power in the United States because the SCANA debacle showed the projects are too expensive and unwieldy.

“I failed the nuclear industry as well. What we hoped would be a nuclear renaissance — we put the brakes on it,” Byrne said.

Since losing his job in 2018, Byrne has been building houses with Habitat for Humanity. His lawyers said he took classes to be an electrician at a technical college so he could better help the organization.

“It is my fervent hope that when I retire I can go on to live a quiet life and no one in here ever hears from me again,” Byrne said.",3,0,1474,1474,,1474,SpaceTabs,Substantial-Pass-992,0

Veterans testify of 'catastrophic' impact of Afghan collapse,"The Afghan war was done all wrong. ""Nation-building"" doesn't work. I don't know how many times we're going to have to fail at it to understand.

We should have gone in, killed bin Laden, and the moment that was accomplished, we should have left. And that could have happened were it not for Rumsfeld.

Veterans testify of 'catastrophic' impact of Afghan collapse,"Pulling out of Afghanistan was absolutely the right thing. I am not convinced the withdrawal would happen in any better way...and the constant chase for a ""better exit"" is what made this war last 20 years.

What we wont hear at this hearing is:

1. The war was stalling and the replacement government was not growing in command of the nation. We were losing ground actively despite huge bombing campaigns that devastated civilian populations.

2. The plan agreed to by the prior admin had conditioned some hard timelines and concessions that meant the Taliban would not attack US bases if we stuck to the timeline. And the Taliban abided by that. Attacks on US troops did stop once this agreement was in place. 

3. Most of the troops remaining had left right before Biden entered office. It committed the US to leaving or otherwise the new admin would need to surge troops back. There was zero planning by the Trump admin into the final withdrawal. His plan really was to just leave one day unannounced. Biden admin decided to delay that exit several months. Which tested the agreement we made with the Taliban, but the Taliban seemed to accept that. 

4. Nobody will be honest that to cancel the exit, meant surging back troops, Taliban resuming attacks on US troops, all while the ""government"" continues to squander resources and lose territory anyway.

Its good we left, the mess was unfortunate. But people need to stop pretending there was some magical no cost alternatives. There was seriously high cost alternatives that would have resulted in US troops dying in Afghanistan to this day.",27,0,292,292,,292,djm19,jray1126,0

Walmart closing stores in this large U.S. city on heels of CEO warning about high theft levels,"Don’t believe the hype. 

Wal-Mart isn’t closing stores because of shoplifters. They only close stores that underperform and can’t make money based on its formula of being the one-stop shop for everything under the sun at rock-bottom prices. 

Wal-Mart employs a strategy of driving supplier prices into the ground, leveraging its status as one of the world’s largest retailers by volume. 

It basically says to suppliers, “No one will buy more of your product than we will. And, our customer base is mainly lower to lower middle class. So you have to give us incredibly cheap prices at wholesale, so we can keep our retail prices ridiculously low.”

That strategy works as long as Wal-Mart’s stores are all moving huge volume, making up for small margins at the unit level by moving huge volumes of units. 

But, as soon as a store stops moving huge volume, it stops making a profit. 

Not to minimize Portland’s problems, but it is far more likely Wal-Mart is closing stores because people aren’t buying what Wal-Mart is selling , at least at sufficient volume to turn a profit.

"By 4-3, Supreme Court says no Miranda warning necessary for man repeatedly told he was under arrest","From the article

>Even though Longmont police warned a man four times he was under arrest, told him ""we are going to take you to jail"" and stood in his doorway, the Colorado Supreme Court on Monday ruled that the man was not effectively in custody at the time.

>The 4-3 decision from the Supreme Court meant the Longmont officers did not need to read Brent A. Willoughby his Miranda rights and, therefore, the incriminating statements he made while officers were inside his apartment can be used against him at trial.

>Citing the officers' ""conversational tone,"" the fact that the door ""remained open"" and Willoughby's ability to smoke a cigar in front of police, Chief Justice Brian D. Boatright explained in the majority opinion that on balance, ""Willoughby’s freedom of movement wasn’t restricted to the degree associated with a formal arrest. Thus, he was not in custody at the time of the interrogation.""

Okay this makes some sense. The person was told ""you're under arrest"" but was never arrested. Thus anything you say before being arrested does not fall under Miranda rights. 

I still disagree and vel8eve if the police don't let you shut your door on them they are detaining you. 

The lesson here is to shut up and lawyer up when you talk to the police.

Elon Musk apologizes after mocking disabled Twitter employee,"This hits me close to home. The disability that he mocked was a kind of muscular dystrophy.

I’ve had those days where I was obligated to spend more spoons than I had available and was left unable to bathe, wipe myself, or feed myself - but I could still use a finger to type out messages.

Muscular dystrophy effects 1 out 3500 male births in America. I’m one of those. Let me tell you here and now that it’s a genetic muscle wasting condition that essentially wastes your muscles the more you use them. I was diagnosed at 12 with preparation for that eventuality.

The hardest thing to convey to people is that “even though I *can* do some things, it’s not *safe* for me to do certain things.” I *may* be able to pick up that shift, or take on extra duties today, but y’all have to realize that I’m obligated to an unknown period of Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness that has cascaded to the point that it’s legit debilitating.

I count myself lucky that most people don’t see my disability plainly when they look at me, but it’s also a curse. I’ve been assaulted in parking lots for making use of disabled spots. I’m constantly dancing around my right not to disclose my condition, and my social obligation to assure people that the accommodations that set me apart from my peers are necessary and hard won, and they don’t nearly level the playing field.

The local Tyson Foods plant could hire kids starting at 16. It had a special program that allowed school kids to work the swing shift for limited hours Monday through Thursday and a full shift Friday. They regularly required Saturday shifts as well.

The local high school supported this effort by offering a class that taught you life skills like creating a budget, managing a checkbook and things like that. If you took this class and you got an after school job, you were rewarded with two credits toward graduation per year and you could leave school two hours early.

Of course 90% of the people that took the class worked at the Tyson plant, lived in the local trailer parks and rarely graduated high school. It was a direct to work pipeline to wage slavery.

I think if the Army wants to improve recruiting, they need to offer clearer paths from the military back to civilian life. Not everyone does 20. And they should really front end opportunities for civilian trades. The rest of the federal workforce does an OK job of hiring vets. But if they streamlined (which requires legislation) a military-to-federal employee path that would also be more appealing. 

Overall, the military is suffering from some of the same problems the modern Catholic Church has. Lack of faith in the institution itself. The root causes are different. But still, for many they don't want the stench of the Army (or Catholic Church) associated with them.

I would say less than half of the people I knew in the military, friends, parents of classmates, neighbors, friends of the family, ect, got any form of VA or compensation after returning home, and 3/4ths of them ended in some kind of divorce or other major marital/family dynamic problems.  
A neighbor had to gun down a kid in a firefight and it really messed him up, and the VA refused to pay for any kind of mental healthcare for him. 
He attempted suicide a year or 2 later. 
A friends dad caught shrapnel to the head from an IED and he had to fight for years to receive *proper* compensation from the government.  
The malls around here were always crawling with recruiters, and when I was a teenager they would hound us constantly and we would laugh in their faces; the cat was already out of the bag by then and the gungho patriotism after 9/11 had faded.

This is not even close to correct and I'm very surprised this made it to publication on a Fox affiliate. Police can ask for you ID whenever they want, just like you can walk up to a stranger and ask for their ID. Police can **demand** that you identify yourself in stop and ID states if they have detained you with reasonable articul**able** suspicion that you committed **or are about to commit** a crime. They do not have to articulate that suspicion to you during the stop and you don't have to have already committed a crime.

Ukraine war: Russian air strikes hit cities across country,">this is what AP posted about it 

Russia launched a massive barrage of missiles and drones that hit residential buildings and critical infrastructure across Ukraine on Thursday, killing six people and leaving hundreds of thousands without heat or electricity.

The largest such attack in three weeks also put Europe’s largest nuclear plant at risk by knocking it off the power grid for hours before it was reconnected. Nuclear plants need constant power to run cooling systems and avoid a meltdown, and the latest threat to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant once again raised the specter of a nuclear catastrophe

Air raid sirens wailed through the night, as the attacks targeted a wide swath of the country, including in western Ukraine, which is far from the front lines.

Memphis approves police reforms after beating death of Tyre Nichols,"Reforms? Are they firing the entire department? No? I didn’t think so.

Reform is a cute way of saying “we’ll punish the unlucky officers who managed to get caught, temporarily change some of our written rules to let the public anger cool off, and then we’ll be back to oppressing people with improved strategies for not getting caught again”. 

You want change? Fire every police officer in the department and replace the method of police staffing with a model based off multiple private contractors- firing a cop should be no more difficult than firing a fast food worker.

* With multiple separate private contractors each providing a share of the total police force, it keeps any sort of police union from having too much power. Every city already negotiates a contract with police unions for manpower- breaking up the power of police unions into disposable smaller bargaining units is a step toward accountability.

* Regularly purge the department (which is easier if you can simply not renew the contract for the force’s various existing contractors), nobody should be a police officer for more than 5 years. This whole “culture of the badge” is part of the problem.

* Punish incompetence. There is a culture in the police service that disdains intelligence and encourages a certain level of mediocrity. We see this in situations where police are allowed to perform their jobs despite not knowing the law, applicants with high qualifications are not selected over those with lesser qualifications, and police regularly fail to report each other for misconduct due to their own pattern of misconduct being reported in retaliation.",3,0,4401,4401,,4401,Kahzootoh,Picture-unrelated,0

"5 Texas women denied abortions sue the state, saying the bans put them in danger","I had a similar situation in 2002 when I was pregnant with twins. I lost one twin and we were were trying to save the second. I started leaking amniotic fluid. The doctors told me there was no hope for survival and they needed to induce labor. He told me if I didn’t, I was risking my health and I could die. I still said no. I was 21 weeks and 2 days, and desperate to make it to the “viable” week 24. My family, accompanied by our pastor, talked me into allowing the doctors to induce. The doctor gave me misoprostol, and I delivered the next day.
This is the same “abortion pill” drug they are now denying women in the same situation.  It was so traumatic and overwhelming. I cannot imagine if this kind of stress had been added to me at that time. It shakes me.

The federal government by way of the US Army is really good a quelling both unrest and peaceful demonstrations. And the 50+ national guard around the country are also pretty good.

""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

Never once does it define what an ""infringement"" is which has left it to the courts to invent arbitrary and contradictory definitions.  For example, if I wanted to buy an AR-15 style weapon that was produced last year and only fires in semi-auto I'd have absolutely no problem doing so. However, if I wanted to buy the same weapon with a full auto configuration I would have a great deal of trouble doing so legally.

Why is that not an ""infringement?"" Why is banning people from owning a rocket launcher and its munitions not an ""infringement?""  Why is banning a 30 round magazine an infringement despite the magazine itself not being ""an arm?"" 

The text of the amendment hinges on what is ""an arm"" and what is an ""infringement"" without explaining either. Of course at the time it was written, none of these issues existed and there was no reason to address them or impose a limit on arms ownership by people when the deadliest weapons were not that deadly and were often prohibitively expensive. 

Today though the issue has become much more complex and I think its time to take Jefferson's advice and rewrite the damn thing

Fun fact: if you install solar panels on your home you are actually FINED by the state. Why? Because the money you save in energy bills “is money owed to the power company and you are pretty much stealing what they are owed.” I shit you not.

Addendum to the fun fact: I have been informed this is no longer the case. It was ONCE the case but they changed it . . .

>Dispatchers said three people were taken to the hospital in Summers County after a train hit a boulder and ended up near the bank of the New River.  
  
The incident involving a CSX train was reported about 5 a.m. Wednesday near Sandstone, dispatchers said.  
  
A statement from CSX said all four of the train's locomotives and at least nine empty coal cars derailed in the incident.  
  
While the train cars were empty, an unknown amount of diesel and oil did leak from the derailed locomotives, CSX said.  
  
At least one locomotive and one fuel tank went into the New River after a rockslide, according to a news release from the West Virginia Emergency Management Division.  
  
State officials said the site of the crash is just south of Sandstone inside the New River National Park and Preserve.  
  
The news release said it is unknown when the tracks will be repaired to allow new rail traffic.",28,0,430,430,,430,DakotaBuckleyWV,DakotaBuckleyWV,0
