My mom has always been a nutjob to say the least. I wasn't vaccinated growing up and got them all when I was an adult. She claimed back then the government was tracking us with microchips. For context, I was born in 1989. In high school I got my meningitis shot and she kicked me out for 3 days. Just crazy shit.


But despite all that she was a decent human.

Post covid she's turned into a psycho. Supporting the trucker movement to the point its all she talks about. Sending me insane articles about Trudeau. She called me saying he was going to take away her pension because she won't get the ""jab"". I told her that was a charter violation and not going to happen. She then went into some tirade about him and Chinese people that was absolutely insane.

Anyway, I now live in the US and called to tell her I am pregnant. I was dreading it but thought I had to. She cried with excitement. I told her my rules were that everyone had to be vaxxed (covid, TDAP, MMR) ETC. she lost her shit and said she will not be taking anything! She'd rather be dead in the streets then take that so she will never meet her grandchildren.

Then she went on some FB rant about what an idiot I am. How she didn't raise me to be so fucking stupid etc etc and how I'm prob going to miscarry anyway because I am vaxxed or my baby will be born deformed.

Safe to say I will not be talking to her for a very long time.
