"Going forward, comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays.","If people find the content funny, it gets voted to the top. Isn't that how this subreddit works? 

As a comic creator, I take offense to you labeling our work as ""low-effort"" and ""poorly made"", or saying our jokes are ""stolen"". You are directly hurting artists with these irresponsible, biased labels

This work takes a lot of time and energy (and abuse) and its provided at **no charge!** You're free to downvote it and move on if it doesn't suit your tastes but you don't get to police what others enjoy, and shame on you for doing just that. Clearly this sub isn't for humor, it's for whatever the mods deem funny based on their own specific tastes.

You could at least mention r/comics or r/webcomics to help drive traffic there, or redirect the users to that subreddit. Feels like that would solve a lot of things.",396,0,1588,1588,"Hey there, folks!

As you're probably aware, there are quite a few very talented, very funny artists who offer their comics in /r/Funny... but there are also a growing number of ""comics"" here that are little more than low-effort ways of bypassing Rule 9. Moreover, subscribers have been expressing their concerns¹ that comics (of both varieties) almost always eclipse every other variety of content offered here.

Basically, on any given day, a poorly made comic featuring a stolen joke has a much better chance of being seen than something well-produced and original. Some of this is the fault of the ""Ennui Engine,"" but it's also the result of there being *so many* comics posted in /r/Funny.

To address this, we're going to experiment with a new approach:

Going forward, comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays PDT (Pacific Daylight Time), and only by the people creating them.²

Our hopes with this are is twofold: 

1. By limiting ""comic days"" to two days a week, other original content will get the chance that it deserves. 

2. Wednesdays and Sundays will come to highlight – with the help of discerning voters, of course – the best comics submitted to the subreddit.³

Moreover, subscribers have been expressing their concerns¹ that comics (of both varieties) almost always eclipse every other variety of content offered here.

Basically, on any given day, a poorly made comic featuring a stolen joke has a much better chance of being seen than something well-produced and original. Some of this is the fault of the ""Ennui Engine,"" but it's also the result of there being *so many* comics posted in /r/Funny.

To address this, we're going to experiment with a new approach:

Going forward, comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays PDT (Pacific Daylight Time), and only by the people creating them.²

Our hopes with this are is twofold: 

1. By limiting ""comic days"" to two days a week, other original content will get the chance that it deserves. 

2. Wednesdays and Sundays will come to highlight – with the help of discerning voters, of course – the best comics submitted to the subreddit.³ 

Those of you who have had nothing better to do than [read our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules) and stay up to date on all of our announcements will know that we aren't *really* changing much, but even so, we wanted to mention the update, explain the reasons behind it, and give folks the chance to discuss⁴ everything.

We'll be trialing this over the next few weeks, and we may end up adjusting things⁵ slightly.

"Going forward, comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays.","I have a funny story related to suicide. 3 years ago, when I was in the 7th grade, I had a fucking day. I wrote a math test for 2 that day, I came home and my parents yelled at me harshly, in addition to school, I worked part-time and was very tired. Then I felt fucked up and lonely, even though I was a big wide kid, I sat on the roof of our house and cried a lot, at that moment I thought my heart would just burst, it hurt a lot. I sat on the roof for a long time, but then when everyone was asleep I decided to suicide. I thought: Nothing will stop me, God himself wants me to do it. I had already hung the rope on the very last step of the stairs, made a loop and was about to leave for another world, but it turns out my older brother was ""calming"" himself that night and did not sleep, through the window he saw me hanging on the stairs without signs of life and how he screamed: What the fuck are you doing? Go to bed, you little fucker. I heard it already from the other world and was very scared, from which I woke up and changed my mind",2,0,1588,1588,"Hey there, folks!

As you're probably aware, there are quite a few very talented, very funny artists who offer their comics in /r/Funny... but there are also a growing number of ""comics"" here that are little more than low-effort ways of bypassing Rule 9. Moreover, subscribers have been expressing their concerns¹ that comics (of both varieties) almost always eclipse every other variety of content offered here.

Basically, on any given day, a poorly made comic featuring a stolen joke has a much better chance of being seen than something well-produced and original. Some of this is the fault of the ""Ennui Engine,"" but it's also the result of there being *so many* comics posted in /r/Funny.

It was the start of the semester, and this was clearly some poor kid's book money, but there was no one else around. 

So I brought it in to the school's lost-and-found (which was not easy to find).

The school had a pretty terrible system in place, where *you* would write down the item you lost in a ledger, right next to every other item that had been turned in. 

It would be easy for someone to turn in something worthless, get a look at the items, and come back later to claim something of value. So I didn't expect the money to be there for long.

Middle Manager,"Scrolling through the comments, there are so many people condescendingly declaring that the person who wrote the comic doesn't have an understanding of the workplace or have much work experience at all. But they also don't cotton on to the premise of a middle-manager asking an employee what they're doing by messaging all day is beyond stupid - it's called communication. 

I've had days as a software engineer where I might get 5 lines of code done and tested, but I've managed to unblock 3 of my team mates with calls and messages. So while my individual output hasn't been huge, the value I've brought to my team (and thus, the company) is significant. 

There are a lot of comments saying that middle management is ""undervalued"", and that the guy in the comic is ""doing his job"" but if this is your idea of effective management, it looks like it's you who is lacking in understanding of the workplace.",-3,0,9685,9685,,9685,ILikeCakeAndViolence,Gazunta,0

One day we caught one of our workers stealing food and so the manager brought him in to fill out/sign a confession slip or something (the store was union so they couldn't fire him immediately but he quit anyway) and then began to chew him out.

During the meeting the manager said something along the lines of ""I've been working here for 30 years and I've seen people think they can just get away with stuff like that-"" and when the manager said that he'd been there for 30 years, the employee's jaw just dropped and he said

&#x200B;

""Dude, you've been working here for 30 years?? What the fuck is wrong with you? Bro..."" and the manager angrily sputtered a bit, rebuttled about the employee's life choices before I walked him out of the store.

Manager had this thousand yard stare on his face for the rest of the day after that. Could never tell if he was just upset by having to fire someone or rattled by what that guy said.

Soul left his body,"Hey Jimmy Arachnophobe! I think I saw a big spider in your cart over there”.  

Then he goes to look.  

Then has a spider attached.  

Let’s be real. 

First off, pranker is behind the dude. I can’t see stuff behind me.  

Second, it seems like he didn’t see the pranker.  

Third, it doesn’t look like the pranker touched him, so the only sensation is “furry arm on ankle”.  

He looks. Sees spider. Tries to kick it off and get away. Straight forwards, no time to look around.  

(Notice that as he kicks, he is attempting to keep his ankle as far away from his body as he can. This plus the screaming would seem to indicate fear.)  

Anyways. He tries to get away, jumps over the cart, still kicking, and runs into the wall. 

It’s still attached. He hits the wall, and now has to turn to see what is attacking him.  

[ Oh fuck. Spider. I’m Jimmy Arachnophobe.]  

It’s been four seconds. He frantically tries to kick it off. This is the part that we can see his face. Even if he can see the recorder, he may not register it due to the panic. He does the frantic kick hop 2-3 times before the realization that it is attaches lights up.  

(Again, keeping the foot away from his other foot, and his body, as much as possible.)  

Now he has to touch it. Nasty.  

Pull it off, huck it away.  Get the fuck out.  

He’s taking the cart because it’s *his fucking cart* (and maybe his livelihood) and he ain’t down with no giant spiders.  

He’s not even saying goodbye. Because the “danger” might still be present.  


Reality?: **plausible**. If it was a fake, I’m ready to hire that actor flat out. Audition passed. I’ve seen people “act” like that because they see a bee. 

Every *prank* is staged, that doesn’t mean the *reaction* always is.

"Man sues Buffalo Wild Wings, saying 'boneless wings' are actually just chicken nuggets","I mean. He has a point, any other boneless cut is that cut without bones. You probably couldn't sell boneless lamb shanks and give someone ground lamb, boneless pork shoulder chops and give someone a sausage, boneless short ribs=hamburger. It's not enough to humiliate chickens by farming them industrially, we also need to disrespect them in commerce by claiming equivalency between their various body parts and appendages? And the wing *is* the most distinctive cut on a chicken, fine grain white meat with a high ratio of tendon/collagen and skin. It's annoying most places charge about the same for boneless, sometimes more, but the breast tenders ( or nuggets) they use are like half the cost of wings. Some local bars should go though the effort of actually deboning wings as a marketing gimmick. (Or offering 'chicken tenders to which the same sauce as our buffalo wings has been applied') They'd have to be $25/lb but they'd be fucking delicious.",4,0,310,310,,310,happyrock,ethereal3xp,0

Offering money for frivolous lawsuit threats is cost effective but encourages more frivolous claims being filed. If not, eventually the parties will go into mediation.

First Flight

Mr. Johnson had never been up in an aerophane before and he had read a lot about air accidents, so one day when a friend offered to take him for a ride in his own small phane, Mr. Johnson was very worried about accepting. Finally, however, his friend persuaded him that it was very safe, and Mr. Johnson boarded the plane.
　　His friend started the engine and began to taxi onto the runway of the airport. Mr. Johnson had heard that the most dangerous part of a flight were the take-off and the landing, so he was extremely frightened and closed his eyes.
　　After a minute or two he opened them again, looked out of the window of the plane, and said to his friend, ""Look at those people down there. They look as small as ants, don't they?""
　　""Those are ants,"" answered his friend. ""We're still on the ground.""",24,0,75,75,,75,poppubbob,SeaWine,0

Texting felt like too much of chore at times, and our schedules never lined up to call/video chat. We then discovered the joy of Snapchat videos. It’s not live video, so we can watch when available, it’s not texting so it doesn’t feel like a chore, and it sends better than voice messages through iMessage (I have iPhone, she has android). It was an all-around win, and now we talk every day. Find what works for you. Maybe your friends just don’t have the willpower or time to text",71,0,3551,3551,,3551,MindlessS0up,TryingTimesComics,0

Sorry to bother you,"Years ago, I used to go to a particular local bar almost every night. I'd get off work, go to the gym for a couple of hours, and then head over to the bar. It was a routine.

And I had a lot of very close friends there. I mean, the kind of friends who would back you in a fight, or help you find a job, buy you a drink when you needed it ... all that good stuff.

One day, I had a very odd falling out with one of my friends, who happened to be one of the bartenders. And against her begging me not to, I left and went home. I was upset.

On getting home I decided I'd give the bar a little break. I figured a couple of weeks would be good, and I started mentally preparing what I'd say to my friends when they called or texted me asking why I wasn't around.

And surprise, surprise: Nobody called or texted.

So two weeks dragged in to a month, and that dragged in to several months, and then a year. I didn't go back to the bar, and not one of those super-close friends ever tried contacting me.

It was a difficult and painful lesson for me. I do have other friends, and am definitely not some social pariah, so after some reflection I was fairly sure it wasn't me.

But even this many years later, it kind of makes me sad.",30,0,3551,3551,,3551,eatstoothpicks,TryingTimesComics,0

Can you pick my sister up from the airport?), and beyond that everything else was just one word replies to my messages regardless of the subject matter. From there I started to think back on times we'd have out in person and realized that 90% of that time we spent together, they were on the phone with someone else...

They may say otherwise but their mind won’t allow them to trust you no matter how much they want to. I’m saying this out of love and respect not out of judgement.

The teacher would then make corrections, again, very much like this. Because I had made the books unique, my girls would call them diaries rather than journals (after being told both are books where you put your thoughts and experiences- oops?- but not really oops).

My house smelled like campfire but I thought my neighbor was burning stuff, because he always burned stuff. I looked out the front window and he was nowhere to be seen. I went into my kitchen and smoke and pouring out of the wall 🤯

I ran outside and found the box on fire, I ran back in and turned the heat off (I had just turned it on, my brain was like “maybe the surge over charged it) and grabbed this fucking kitchen extinguisher that’s been in my kitchen since before I was sentient. I also thought “DONT USE WATER” and the pitiful squirt from that extinguisher put most of it out. I then thought “Should I call dad?” which immediately was overran with “NO IDIOT CALL 911 YOUR FUCKING HOUSE IS ON FIRE!”

After all that I took a video of it and sent it to him and then called him and said “LOOK AT THE VIDEO I SENT YOU” then he asked me if I used the extinguisher in the garage….. which I didn’t even know was there…..

The cool part was the electrical box was right above the gas meter so if I hadn’t had caught it early my house would have went kaboom",2,0,70188,70188,,70188,Long_Procedure3135,Fuzzy-Quit-9297,0

The only reason steroids are banned in sports is because we collectively PRETEND that we want it to be a healthy activity.

In addition, we secretly WANT to vicariously experience the equivalent of gladiatorial battle among people other than ourselves.

His legs don’t work but his sense of humor does,"Thankyou GPT4 for the detailed explanation of this plate (not really a south park watcher):

*The personalized number plate ""TIMMAY"" is likely a reference to a character named Timmy from the animated television show ""South Park."" The character, Timmy Burch, is a disabled boy who uses a wheelchair and is known for his catchphrase, ""Timmy!"" pronounced with an elongated and drawn-out tone.*  
  
*It's possible that the owner of the personalized number plate is also named Timmy or has a connection to the character in some way. Alternatively, they may have simply chosen the plate as a way to express their sense of humor or to pay tribute to the character.*  
  
*In any case, the fact that the owner of the plate is disabled suggests that they may have a personal connection to the character or the show's portrayal of disability. It's also possible that the plate serves as a way for the owner to reclaim a word or phrase that has historically been used to mock or belittle disabled individuals.*",48,0,2852,2852,,2852,BlueEther_NZ,wirthit,0

Seeing Red,"And now my friends you've asked me what makes me sad and still

And why my brow is darkened like the clouds upon the hill

Run in your ponies closer and I'll tell to you my tale

Of Utah Carol my partner and his last ride on the trail

&#x200B;

We rode the range together and rode it side by side

I loved him like a brother, and I wept when Utah died

We were rounding up one morning when work was almost done

When on his side the cattle started on a frightened run

&#x200B;

Underneath the saddle that the boss's daughter rode

Utah that very morning had placed a bright red robe

So the saddle might ride easy for Lenore his little friend

And it was this red blanket that brought him to his end

...

On his funeral morning I heard the preacher say

I hope we'll all meet Utah at the roundup far away

Then they wrapped him in a blanket that saved his little friend

And it was this red blanket that brought him to his end",0,0,228,228,,228,Perrin42,InkyRickshaw,0

Then one of the members of the school staff decided to complain about it, put a note in my, i don't know how it's called but like a book where teachers will send notes to parents, alerting my mom i've been sketching all over their books.

Mom's reply was ""they're yours, i paid for them, it's not their books anymore"".

She forgot that i was one of those kids who need to be given clear orders cause we take anything literally. Next day, i get to school, the woman looks to me and asks ""so, your mom saw the note?"".

""Yes"". ""So?"". ""So, she said it's my book and i can draw on it as I please"". 

She stood there, speechless, as i went to my class. Never got why she would be a pita for the rest of my time there, only got it when i was way older.",3,0,39269,39269,,39269,WilkerFRL94,WelshTractor,0

My daughter just sent me this from school…,"I can relate to this!  Does she struggle with math type things?  I did but was embarrassed about it so I would draw detailed flowers on my papers.  She may have a math disability, just like me.  There are tests she can take to determine math issues and if she has them, her schooling can be adjusted to not include math requirements all the way through college and even Grad School.  

My parents were both fantastic at math and didn't understand why I struggled.  Pushing me made it worse.  I felt really stupid and embarrassed.  

I had to take Algebra to graduate from high school and the teacher quickly recognized my frustration and asked some questions, then referred me for testing.  Sure enough, I have a math disability.  My Algebra teacher said she was sorry I struggled for so long and was irritated none of my prior teachers made time to help me.  She didn't make me feel stupid, she was really supportive.  

A side effect of this diagnosis was my self esteem got much better because finally I realized I was not stupid.  The biggest benefit was I never had to take any math in high school or University.  I got my PsyD without any math.  I am eternally thankful for Ms. Morrison and her support and encouragement.",0,0,39269,39269,,39269,Valbertnie,WelshTractor,0

Building A PC Sucks,"That hurts. I quit doing this for people many, many years ago, but I experienced something close enough once or twice... I remember how that could sting. I was properly compensated, but still.

Something similar that stung: after spending hours or even days researching parts and stuff for a friend of a friend with a laundry list of demands and wishes, I eventually gave that person a link to a complete shopping cart, telling them ""just buy this and I will put it together for you for a penny and a cookie"". You know, because of the mutual friend, and all. A week or two later I inquired ""Hey, did you think about that computer?"", only to hear back ""Oh yeah, I just went to $BIG\_STORE\_THAT\_SELLS\_COMPUTERS\_BUT\_ALSO\_UNDERWEAR\_AND\_POTATOES and bought an HP"". Or some other big brand, I forget, it has been over a decade. An 'HP' that came in a shitty case with one whole 80mm fan in the back that was basically blowing full speed against 80% metal, with a generic (obviously non-modular) power supply, with what looked like a cooler designed for Intel sockets 'cleverly' mounted with some whoopteedoo bracket on a two generations old AMD processor, with one RAM module on a dual-channel capable platform, with a graphics card that barely beat a then current gen Intel IGP that somehow still ~~needed~~ had a noisy fan. Back then 80GB or even 120GB SSDs had been pretty affordable for quite some time... but, alas, no such luck, of course. Instead, they got a video capture card, which had not been on the laundry list.

So, scientists aren't 100% sure why they have such large noses, but they've got a few ideas. One thought is that the females really dig the big noses, so the males with the largest schnozzes end up being more successful in finding a mate. That would mean, over time, the nose size would just keep getting bigger.

Another idea is that the big nose might help them make louder calls. Kind of like a built-in microphone, it could help amplify their sounds, making them more attractive or noticeable to other monkeys.

And finally, there's a theory that those big noses could help the monkeys stay cool in the hot and humid environment they live in by getting rid of extra heat from their bodies.",7,0,424,424,,424,priceactionhero,falcon215tier,0

I saw Ke Huy Quan at a grocery store in Los Angeles a few months ago. I told   
him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a   
douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my  
 face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him   
chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw   
him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Chachapoyan Fertility Idol replicas in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was  
 like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept   
pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back   
around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the props and started scanning it multiple times, he  
 stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any  
 electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I   
don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each item and put them   
in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by

Aristocat,"Keep in mind that many large corporations sign deals with cities to site their campuses where they do.

These deals often involve significant incentives to the corporation such as property tax forgiveness for, say 20 years. This is in exchange for *demonstrating* that the corporation has created X-number of seats and will fill them.

The corporation reaps significant financial benefits from this arrangement while the city not only gets to claim X-number of jobs are created within it, but also that any workers attracted to those jobs from outside the city are likely to be well educated, high earning people who will benefit the culture and economy of the city.

What you hopefully see here is that the company must, contractually, prove to the city that those seats are filled with actual workers physically present on-site.

One of the primary goals of workers is to maximize their self-interest. When a work at home situation occurs, workers will inevitably weigh the amenities of the city versus its (likely) high cost of living. At least some of those workers will want to move to cheaper places where their purchasing power will go further.

This creates a conflict of interest for the corporation which shelled out major money to build the campus in the first place and will not see that expense offset by the city’s incentives if its workers aren’t filling those seats.

This has created a situation where workers in roles which are just as productive when done remotely feel like they are getting short squeezed by their employers who are forcing them, seemingly counterintuitively, back into on-site office work.

The corporations don’t want to tell their employees why because the employees are unlikely to be sympathetic to the corporation’s story of potentially unrecoverable campus construction costs.",2,0,36664,36664,,36664,eGregiousLee,Casual_Deviant,0

Watching the DoorDash App for my Delivery [OC],"Some answers for DD customers who have concerns. 
Addresses: 1.)Sometimes drivers can't see peeled off numbers on mailboxes, missing numbers, or sometimes no numbers at all, just reliance on a shitty gps and customers who take 10 minutes to respond to calls or txts if at all. And if it's dark, drivers definitely have trouble seeing, especially when you don't turn on your porch light. 2.)Just because you think your house is easy to find doesn't mean it's the same for everyone else. You live there, they have to find hundreds of houses a week.

Messaging: Simple, it is dangerous to txt and drive, and it takes longer to get food if the driver has to keep stopping to answer txts. 

Special instructions: Drivers cannot alter or add to your order. Many restaurants won't even give extra condiments if not stated on the order. They can only pick up and deliver unless something has to be substituted by the restaurant.

Expectations: Honesty, if you're not tipping 3+, don't ask for anything special, just hope you get your food. For most drivers, they go the extra way for customers who do as well. But low or no tipping = a subpar experience & unread msgs. Just my experiences as both a driver and customer in the suburbs. The cities may be a different experience.",0,0,5645,5645,,5645,Rocknrollaaaaa,BrianWonderful,0

at this point I'm pissed so i call customer service and tell them what happened. I had already used the app to get my refund, but at this point i at least want something for this. I mean a random door dasher picked my food up that they can't look up see (which i really believe is a lie) and the restaurant was closed so they couldn't make me my food. normally i wouldn't complain cause shit happened but this is far from a reg mistake and the fact they couldn't just contact the other dasher means that dasher was now eating my 35 dollar steak. because there is no way they through it away.  I'm not stupid, cause if i was them i would just eat it myself.

anywho, when i told customer service that they said they would try and give me some credit for a free meal or what not put me on hold for 15 min. then came back to tell me there computer wasn't working and they couldn't' do it and there was nothing else they could do. i asked can you get me another person to do it and she said ""no, there is nothing more i could do"" in a tone that was like her saying just hang up there is nothing i can do. so i did, and deleted my account for door dash and uninstalled the app,",1,0,5645,5645,,5645,Korlog_Kashin,BrianWonderful,0

People falling in to the water because they think this is a gravel road.,"Years ago, when my son was three, he suddenly/without warning swung under a railing on a pier that had thick green algae on top of the water—that he mistakenly believed was grass.

When he hit the algae—he disappeared. 

Literally, it was like he had been swallowed up by the lake, and there was no trace of him left behind.

I was about 20 feet away from him, holding his baby brother, when I saw it happen—and my heart stopped. 

In fact even typing this out takes me back to that day, and the absolute terror that I felt when I saw it happen.

I handed his brother to my daughter, and ran as fast as I could to the area he had disappeared. 

As I did so, I thought—where is he in the water, how deep is he, how am I going to find him??!!??!!

But almost like an answer to all of my questions—I saw his hand suddenly pop up from the algae for a split second, before disappearing again.

Thankfully, that glimpse was all I needed, as I dove through the railing and pulled him out to safety.",5,0,130337,130337,,130337,PeterQuinnInRealLife,Kachelpiepn,0

Let me do it for you...let me eat you...kermie,"It's rare to go into polar bear territory without a high-caliber weapon, and most Arctic guides will carry a gun with them. Step 2: Use bear pepper spray. As with all other species of bear, pepper spray is your most effective method of fighting off a polar bear
Know the warning signs 

Polar bears will exhibit certain behaviors when they’re curious about you, such as sniffing the air, moving their ears forward or flattening them back, staring directly at you or huffing and popping their jaws. Watch for these cues that they’ve noticed you, and they’re interested.  
Stay calm and communicate 

If you see a polar bear, keep your voice calm and quiet and communicate with your group about where the bear is, what it is doing and what your escape route should be. 
Don’t run 

Despite their immense size, polar bears are surprisingly agile and running away might alert them to your presence (also, you can’t outrun them). Keep facing the bear and keep it in your sights at all times as you slowly back away and prepare to make a wide detour around the bear. 
Stay down wind 

Polar bears have an extremely sensitive nose, so if possible, stay downwind from them and they may not detect you. This means that if you’re facing a polar bear, the wind should be blowing into your face, not against your back. 

6. Be prepared to fight 

If a polar bear looks set to charge at you, it’s probably not a false alarm. You and your group should stick together, drop your backpacks and arm yourself with anything heavy and sharp, such as your ice axes and trekking poles, that you can use as a weapon. Don’t play dead as this just makes it easier for the polar bear to eat you. ",45,0,10051,10051,,10051,McRatHattibagen,smut_butler,0

When the polar bear stuck its head between the ladder bars, would the person have been able to pet it? It doesn’t look like it has enough room to bite at that point and normally people can’t get that close safely be able to pet a polar bear on the snout.

Let me do it for you...let me eat you...kermie,"There’s a saying when it comes to dealing with bears…

***if it’s black, fight back.*** Black bears are often frightened by loud noises or anything that appears to be larger than them. So waving your arms over your head and yelling will be the best defense against a black bear (assuming you are unarmed.) 

***if it’s brown, lie down.*** grizzlies typically will not attack something they think is dead. So if corned by a grizzly (and again, unarmed) the best hop is to play dead. Now, it’s likely a grizzly will swat you with its paw or maybe even push you around a bit to make sure you’re dead. But ultimately, it’s highly likely of it believes you’re dead, it will leave you alone. 

***if it’s white, say goodnight.*** polars are assassins, plain and simple. A polar doesn’t care if you’re bigger and louder. It doesn’t care if you’re dead. A Polar will run you down and rip you to shreds. Also, a polar (this is true for all bears) will not kill you quickly. It will hold you down with its paws while it uses its teeth to rip meat from your body. It will sit n your abdomen while it eats your legs and arms. It will be an excruciating death that will feel like it takes hours. 

Statistically speaking, the best defense against any bear is bear spray. It’s even more effective than a gun. Bears are extremely tough and unless your shoot a bear with a very high caliber firearm, a gun likely won’t do anything. I have a house in bear country and whenever I go out for walks, I carry bear spray and a large caliber firearm.",1,0,10051,10051,,10051,Nathan_Wind_esq,smut_butler,0

Visited a farm in Australia with good sense of humour,"A very sheltered friend of mine (white American) often acted like a little kid in her early 20s because she grew up with Christian media as her only entertainment, and youth groups as her only social outlet. One day we were commuting by train and she started singing a kids' rhyme about llamas that ended with ""President Obama Llama!"". Then suddenly she looked stricken and was very quiet until we got off the train half an hour later.

I ended up asking her if she was okay, and it turns out she saw a black couple a few rows over from us right after finishing her song, and she was terrified that she offended them by ""being disrespectful about Obama"". I asked her if she *meant* to be disrespectful about Obama, and she said of course not. I'm not sure that she bought my reassurances that it was very unlikely that that couple gave a damn about a phonics song for elementary schoolers. They probably just wondered why a 23 year old was singing about llamas on a train. A whole other time that we were out, she asked me if I thought she offended a black McDonald's cashier by asking for a vanilla milkshake, and she was 100% serious although at least she believed me when I said ""no"" that time.

These are some very random memories I just had unearthed by a reference to Obama llamas.",2,0,6016,6016,,6016,theluckyfrog,sparekh1,0

If Person B buys one of the $4.48 item, it costs them $4.82.
