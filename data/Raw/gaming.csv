What are you playing Wednesday!,"Octopath Traveler 2. What's great about it?

* Surpasses the original in every way.
* Combat has a fast forward
* You unlock a boat and can sail around exploring
* I've been in the post game for over 10 hours and am still finding new side quests (marked/ unmarked) and surprises.  There are mysteries that to have yet to solve and hidden bosses everywhere.  
* Actions of the protagonists change the game world alot.  Stories and their outcomes really matter. Towns change, and the map expands to like double it's base size. 
* In game organic storytelling is leaps beyond the original.  Interacting with a random npc can lead down a rabbit hole. 
* Major quests have epilogues and can go even further than that. 
* Two of the hidden classes work in awesome/unique ways. I still haven't even found all of them. 
* You can even recruit some of the final bosses and major side characters.
* You can rob children.

I could go on.  I cannot describe my disappointment with all the reviews that pegged this game as too much like the original.  It goes beyond it in an insane amount of ways.  Zero wasted space. Details within details.  It's the game that the original wanted to be.",12,0,16,16,"What game's got your attention this week? What's great about it? What sucks? Tell us all about it!

What are you playing Wednesday!,"Beat Sekiro like 4 times. Decided to pick the game back up after dropping it 2 years ago. I had recently platinum'd Bloodborne so I was feeling confident. Once I beat Lady Butterfly I knew I could do it. Sekiro is amazing. Wanted to get the platinum, but because of a save glitch I did I would have to beat it 2 more times AND grind levels and materials for upgrades. Nah, I'm good. Amazing game though. 

Edit: Got the platinum. Fuck that XP grinding and Isshin Ashina can blow me. Genuinely think he's harder than Sword Saint 

Tried Demon's Souls remake, but after that much Sekiro I just can't do it. The game feels too...clunky? It's so slow and I have 0 clue where tf to go.

SUCH a beautiful game! AND they added filters so if you want it to resemble the original more, you can change the saturation and whatnot. VERY appreciated feature. The sound design is also SUPERB. What a way to showcase what the PS5 and dualsense can do.

What are you playing Wednesday!,"Just about to finish up Atomic Heart. Had no expectations going in, and I haven't put it down. Playing on Hard feels like a really good difficulty, normal would have been a push over. 

The best explanation I've heard of this game so far is, ""Imagine Bioshock 1 and 2 but with Duke Nukem as the main character."" The dialogue at first is like wtf, then you understand it's done with purpose, and holy shit is it funny. Your character constantly complains about the ""video gamey"" aspects of the adventure.

Combat is always engaging and fun. Plenty of weapons, upgrades and abilities. There's no penalty for respeccing, and demolishing weapons gives you a 100% return, including upgrades. I had to utilize this a couple times to my advantage on some of the harder fights. I found my favorites but it's fun to be able to try new approaches and not be penalized for it.

The dialogue was a cringe fest and the overarching character growth is basically recycled three times over. Oh hey look, Lara has to put aside her ambition and ego to save a person.... again.

They literally took out everything of the original games that made Lara and the plot unique and fun and reduced her to a wannabe Nathan Drake minus the superficial attempts at charisma.

It’s Mindblowing How Unappreciated this Trilogy is,"I have really mixed feeilings about those games. They are really good but also kind of only meh.

They really lack focus. Imho the first one is the best of the series because it is a lot more limited in its scope and actually has a decent flow to it. The second and third one are really hurt by all its treasure hunting and side stuff. Many side stuff is just bad and it is not fun to collect bird feathers and whatever. The tombs are great but there is so much other stuff. All the main game stuff is fantastic but its pacing is destroyed by the semi open world. The open world is great in it self but the two things really do not work well together.

The story is a total mess and Lara ist just the most entiled arsehole with zero self reflection you have ever met. And most other characters are just the same. The supernatural story is typical for the franchise but is so unreasonable that it just breaks the immersion every time I think about it. Really? Ancient mayan civilasation still existing in some undiscovered valley? And fuck audio logs you can only listen to while in menu. Just fuck that.

The gameplay is really good in all the games and gets better the more you move on, but it is totally overshadowed for me by all the minor issues that amount to a game which is great to play the first time, kind of outstays its welcome and really leaves you no desire to replay it.

You play it, you have a good time, you immediately forget everything about it. Good but not great. And it is sad, because you can see a gem in the rough.",1,0,1426,1426,,1426,TheMegaDriver2,xiosy,0

It’s Mindblowing How Unappreciated this Trilogy is,"The trilogy was *okay* at best imo.

The first was amazing. One of the best of its genre, and certainly the best Tomb Raider game. Everything from the story to the visuals to the mechanics were polished and felt amazing to play. 

The second had some notable improvements to the combat, but didn't really offer much more meaningful and the story felt like it was sort of rushed out the door with half-assed pacing.

The third was, in my opinion, utter shit. Everything it did was a strict downgrade from the previous installments, and the whole supernatural save the world thing was just kind of... boring. One thing I think that game devs could learn is that not every installment needs to up the ante l, so to speak. It started out with trying g to protect a treasure from some poachers, why did it have to take a turn to a deity trying to take over the world?

And given what it copied (uncharted) I understand why. To me it has more in common with until dawn then tomb raider.

Tomb Raider (2013) 

You really get sucked into the story, and you really feel for the characters and what they have to endure.  Gameplay really makes you feel ""more competent"" with progression of the game, even if you ignore the upgrade and crafting part for most of the game.

Story is pretty straight forward, and basicly there are 3 active fractions, you, the baddies and the mysterious  undead ancients.

&#x200B;

Rise of the Tomb Raider

Takes a bit of time, but especially the ""Witch"" part is cool. Some of the fights seem to be unfair/random, especially when some of your tactics is just blocked by ""plotarmor"" and trigger events.  I indeed spent time on collecting stuff and on achievements before moving on in the story.

Story seems to reuse the ""undead ancients"" in another form, but it adds natives.

Also feels more like a game, and less like an interactive story. Jumping into freezing waters in siberia and then walk around casually always broke ""suspension of disbelief"".

Also I don't understand why you need skins. Outfit that gets torn over the adventure is cool.

Shadow of the Tomb Raider

The most ""Calladuddy"" one for me.  Even if they introduced the cool mud/wall mechanic, it felt totally random when groups of enemies suddenly get alerted.

So the best way was just to Bulldozer through every level and then suddenly game was over.",1,0,1426,1426,,1426,ktElwood,xiosy,0

I just build my PC with an Intel i713700K and an RTX 4080 OC from Gigabyte so yes I bought them all again for my PC. I started playing the first at Max Settings at insane Frame Rates which I am capped at 165Hz Due to my 1440p LG Monitor.

The plot of the first one was soooo cool, with the final climb being so Cinematic and awesome!

The second one really did a lot of quality of life improvements and felt much more fluid. I also liked the added emphasis on exploration, whereas the first one felt a tad more linear (I mean there were challenge tombs in the first one, but Rise had so much more).

And the third one I looooooved all the stealth kills and whatnot that they added. Rope arrowing enemies into trees, hiding in the vines and stabbing enemies with your knife I felt like the freaking Predator!

I really really want them to do a fourth one. We have one in Japan, Siberia, and South America, so I think it would be cool if the next one was in Africa (maybe the Congo?

Logo evolution of notable gaming brands,"Riot games was a solid rebrand. It made the logo easier to read, while at the same time capturing the chaotic-ness of the original logo by implementing an icon of a haphazard fist.

Bandai Namco is certainly more modern, but in terms of versatility it’s rather lacking. Not saying horizontal or vertically challenged logos are bad, but having a close symmetrical balance between the two allows for easier and more diverse application. 

Rockstar is Rockstar.

Atari is rather tragic. It’s a solid rebrand; classic, bold, original. But what was it all for? What is Atari really known for aside from its classic games? When you think of Atari you think of something antiquated and forgotten. Sure they have their hands in some modern titles, but nothing that compares to the originals. “Your father’s console”.

EA, similarly, has nothing to show for its rebrand. Sure it’s modern and clean, but it doesn’t speak much for the products they produce. 

Lastly, that I’ll touch on that is, would be Bethesda. The “tried and true” of old school to modern RPG games. What started as a dynamic and original take, ended up turning into a mainstream and simplified experience (and I’m not just talking about their logo here). Truly, their newer mark represents perfectly how people view their products nowadays: pretty cool on first glance with modern tones, but ultimately it doesn’t compare to their original stuff. I loved Morrowind, I adored Oblivion, I fell in love with Fallout 3, but their recent dilemmas with products has certainly raised the question of if they are as good as they once were. (Or maybe they’ve always been this divisive?)

This is all coming from a graphic designer, and a gamer, who’s had a few too many Bud Light Platinums. So take it with a grain of salt I guess, but there is certainly some story telling going on here with these logo developments.",18,0,51444,51444,,51444,SerExcelsior,landocharisma,0

"Bird or Cage? Which one did you choose, and why? My Elizabeth cosplay from Bioshock Infinite","Cage cause there is no bird in the cage, so she must of flew away which is what she ends up doing.

I figure the bird being free could imply that someone’s watching the bird, enamoured by its grace and beauty, and perhaps desires to put the bird in a cage and make it theirs.


So by giving her the bird necklace it’s kinda fucked cause booker is essentially just using her and treating her like an object, a tool even to get what he wants.

There are points in the story where booker simply admires her shining aura (like the dancing scene right after the cage escape actually…hmm) and she has powers too and alot of people want to trap her and make her their tool/object.

By giving her the empty cage your implying that she is free, not in anyone’s control, and maybe a little bit of melancholy is felt because the bird left his cage and well…all he has now is an empty cage and no bird.


There is alot of symbolism in bio shock infinite, but this is my interpretation of the choice being presented to booker and kinda of a trap for booker subconsciously (especially the ending when you know his identity) I think those two character giving booker the choice was actually a test to see if he remembers/invoke his dormant self.

It’s actually a super good game when you break it down and all the narrative beats, symbolism and lore.

And goddamn gorgeous even still today on console. 

I don’t really remember a lot of games stories but I remember almost every story beat, every conversation, and every big moment from the game.

Nothing to see here,"Need to have a game just built around killing guards, with consequences. Like, there's what *appears* to be a mainline story. But whatever it is, guard killing is very much a thing and wiping out an area diminishes guards. Over time, sections of the city become more rampant with crime.you start seeing extortioners, pimps and prostitutes, child gangs, vandalism, theft, unkept buildings and streets, etc.

And after you beat the supposed main-line story, you have the post story, which is actually the *real* main story. A gritty, violent romp through this criminal underground you created. And even after you cull out the worst of the worst of the criminal elements, unite the street gangs, and add standards to the criminal empire's doings so their a lil less violent and a lil more helpful, you get a post-game cinematic where, upon your death, the entire underground just goes to shit without the myrder-god to enforce things and the city goes belly up.",1,0,31063,31063,,31063,DoughDisaster,johnlen1n,0

Someone casually donates an Xbox One S at my Goodwill,"When I was 15 or 16, my youth pastor let me borrow his PS4 to play The Last of Us for the first time. After I beat the game and went to return it, he refused to take it back. ""Keep it. It's yours now."" I was like no way man this is too much. This was around 9 years ago, so a ps4 was still the system to have. I couldn't believe this man was giving me his ps4 just like that with nothing in return.

Anyways, fast forward many years and it's around Christmas time. I'm with my girlfriend who is talking on the phone with her mom about Christmas gift ideas. They're discussing one of their family members who I know isn't exactly in the greatest financial situation and how they've been searching everywhere for a Playstation for their son and can't find one they can afford. He's like early elementary school age. Just kind of spontaneously I tell my gf that I'll give them my ps4 to gift to their son and all the games.

It felt good to pay forward the generosity that was shown to me many years prior. I know it made that kid's entire Christmas. I had the jackpot of games too. Just about every major release from the last many years + some.

I sure was missing that thing when God of War 2 came out this year though since I don't have a ps5 lmao.",99,0,8848,8848,,8848,SweetnessBaby,caseyfrazanimations,0

I built a ChatGPT-like bot that suggests games based on over 100k posts and comments from r/ShouldIbuythisgame.,"I'm often relying on Reddit when doing research on games, but there are many repetitive questions and recommendations here. That's why I built a bot based on over 100k comments and posts from this subreddit to embody the collective knowledge of Reddit game community.

Some recent posts that I tried to answer with the bot:

* [what are some good horror games to start with on xbox?](https://www.looria.com/bot/games?q=what+are+some+good+horror+games+to+start+with+on+xbox%3F)
* [looking for a large, long, epic story rpg, high fantasy](https://www.looria.com/bot/games?q=looking+for+a+large%2C+long%2C+epic+story+rpg%2C+high+fantasy)
* [sib resident evil 2 remake?](https://www.looria.com/bot/games?q=sib+resident+evil+2+remake%3F)

It's far from perfect and comes with limitations:

* Outdated information: I'll try to improve this by factoring in recency of the posts and comments. I also want to add more statistical significance to the results, e.g. by clustering suggested games and platforms.
* Hallucination: As always with these bots, they sometimes make things up. More training data should help here.
* Performance: Generating the answers is pretty slow and I'll look into improving this.

Take it with a grain of salt and look at it as a fun experiment :) Would love to hear your feedback!",3,0,65,65,,65,madredditscientist,madredditscientist,0

I am making a strategy game where you can turn everything upside down,"Reminds me of those movies where things a built on the inside of a tube or ring in space.

That could be a part of the theme once you get the game mechanics down pat. If it's a tube spinning mid ship you have a limit how far forward and back you go, but can rotate endlessly, and if it's a ring you can scroll forward and back endlessly but only have 3 plains you may flip between (and animate an empty starfield you can't build on for the fourth).

Seems like space themed games fair well.

Why video game protagonists have become so chatty,">These games need to earn back their colossal budgets. If the player feels like they’ve overlooked essential content, or they become stuck on a puzzle, it could adversely affect sales. “If we spent $50 million on this cool dungeon,” Jo Berry explained, “we’re going to make sure the player doesn’t feel like they’re missing out.”

And then Elden Ring comes over and shits all over it, winning GOTY.

Why video game protagonists have become so chatty,"It’s a thousand times better than a wooden, soulless protagonist that doesn’t talk. I loved Persona 5, but Joker was by far the worst part. 11 was the worst part of DQ11.",0,0,8,8,,8,Jayce86,redhatGizmo,0

Why video game protagonists have become so chatty,"I don't think chatty is a bad thing in and of itself, but it's the quality of what is said. Take GTA 5 (and by extension, GTA Online). A lot of the primary character dialogue in the main game is great. It moves the story, it's entertaining, and in Trevor's case...seriously out there. The NPC dialogue of people just walking around the street is quite entertaining. Go to GTA Online and the ambient NPC dialogue is great, but the NPC dialogue of the idiots that call you and hire you for jobs are some of the most annoying I have ever experienced in a video game. I'm glad players don't have talking characters because it would probably get old real quick.",1,0,8,8,,8,Kiethblacklion,redhatGizmo,0

Why video game protagonists have become so chatty,"Because it vastly improves the singleplayer experience, in most cases, to have a protagonist with a firm, defined personality as well as goals to achieve. It allows the player to more readily relate to the player character, and thus enriches the story considerably. In other words, for the same reason you don't see a lot of silent protagonists with no ideas or motivation of their own.

The Last of Us was amazing then and now.,"Unpopular opinion: the game was boring, gameplay wasn't fun, story was predictable, repetitive and unoriginal.

This game only got popular because it looked great for the time. It did have good writing and character development too.

I tried to play this game when it came out and couldn't even finish it. It was basically the overdone trope of 'this is a zombie survival game but really it is more about human nature and how humans are the real monsters' that all zombie movies and media has been relying on so much in the past few years. The game is basically take this girl from point A to point B, but then you get to point B and realize 'oh damn this is not the right place' so you now have to go to point C, and then you get there and realize 'oh the people who were supposed to be here are not, they moved to point D' so now you have to go to point D, and so on and so forth again and again. 

The whole thing of Ellie being the cure and having to protect her while some evil group actually just wants to use her to create a cure is also nothing original, has already been done over and over again in zombie movies, a quick example being the movie 28 weeks later. 

As for gameplay, the game tries to make you sneak around but the mechanics aren't great so you always end up getting into unnecessary fights, and then the fight/combat mechanics aren't great either (like uncharted this is something Naughty Dog has always struggled with) and ends up being more frustrating than anything. 

So, the only truly enjoyable moments are when you are just walking around enjoying the views and the setting, which was more interesting years ago when the game graphics were groundbreaking, but for today's standards TLOU1 graphics are no longer that amazing.",-1,0,15696,15696,,15696,thezim2,gamingquarterly,0

Also, I'm not Mormon, but having lived there my whole life... I've got a few gripes about the state of SLC. The Mormon church is one of the largest businesses in the country. Maybe even globally.

Do you have any kind of player journal, or way to keep track of these things occurring? Skyrim had similar mechanics, but unless you were diligently roleplaying it rarely felt like a result of your actions, just felt like things were happening randomly. There was no record as to why things are happening in that context.        
       
If your character had a journal with a section for crimes. And made small entries like:      
       
“I stole something from X in Y town. The guards caught me but I refused to pay the fine and ran away. Later I was confronted by bounty hunters, but I chose to run from them as well. I’ve been laying low for a few days, maybe the heat has died down.”

Pretty sure my half life cd was somewhere in there. Dad said I could take the old PC when he moved. Fire it up at home. Get on my newer steam account I had lost access to. I figured out I had an old account with lots of games also tied to this email. 

Steam won’t give me the old steam account I lost access to when I had some health issues many years ago unless I give them the cd key for my half life. Whoops. That’s lost in boxes or trash across the country. Can’t help me because the account is “old and valuable” and they won’t budge even though my email has been used on that account for like 20 years at least. They let me on another account on this email and treat me like a scammer for an account I didn’t even remember I had that I would love to see all my old games on. 

If my dad finds the half life cd key in a box, that’d be great. But this just sucks.

If it doesn’t turn up; I wonder if they’ll tell me the games I own but that they won’t let me use. So I can buy them again in steam.

It was a mix of incentive to get players to use their new fangled software thingamajig and a way for those with less than perfectly legal versions of the game to come clean. Because way back when to play any of the OG half-life one mods online you needed one \*legal\* CD-key that could be from any of the retail versions of the game from half-life to the ""stand-alone"" counter-strike. But because of the way Half-Life and many PC games of the time worked it treated expansions and mods exactly the same with how it detected them so it was like super duper easy to copy that floppy.

So when Steam rolled onto the scene, Valve decided rather than alienating a bunch of people who have probably pirated at least some of the expansions of their games, just give everyone with any legitimate copy of half-life all of the expansions and add-ons and call it a day.

At the time I was very bugged off by the notion that 'when the online service stops working, so do the games I have on that service'. Still am, but that's not the point.

Anyway, in the attemts to re-access my account I contacted the helpdesk and they were kind enough to help me unlock it by any means possible. Ended up by photographing my opened HL1 jewel case with the game's serial number (which was tied to that account) on the backdrop of that helpdesk conversation. It got me my Steam account back and I couldn't be happier.",1,0,1918,1918,,1918,zkee_,its_bme,0

The beauty of some No Man's Sky planets impresses me .,"Awesome shot, it really is a spectacularly pretty game at times, my friend and I spent ages just searching for interesting looking planets. I think my most memorable one was was lit in black and white (with slight red tones), it was like being a noir novel. 

The animals could sure use some more variety though. There's only so many crabs or mammals with tiny heads you can see before you wonder how they somehow managed to colonize the galaxy before you.

Same largely goes for ships, but you can still get occasional unique looking ones. Other than the living ship, squid, and various orbs, I think my fav is a long nose fighter with an R2 unit in white & red that looks like an X-Wing.

The graphics is amazing even for current gen console.",3,0,6,6,"I've gamed across pretty much every console since the PS1/N64 days. 
Around about 2013, I was a massive Tomb Raider fan who decided to trade my PS4 in for an Xbox One at the time so that i wouldn't have to wait to play Rise Of The Tomb Raider. As time went by, Microsoft implemented backwards compatibility and then Gamepass.

By then, i was pretty much sticking with Xbox for the foreseeable future. I managed to grab a Series X on release and was blown away by how seamless everything was integrated & accessible on the now current gen console. It was quite amazing playing so many older titles with FPS boosts, increased resolution, etc. 

Playstation had slightly caught my attention with the wealth of incredible exclusives that they had been releasing constantly. In the last two years or so, there hadn't been many great Xbox Exclusives besides Gears 5  & Hi-Fi Rush IMO. It slowly dawned on me that my Series X had just been primarily playing games from last gen and even earlier. I took the leap last week and swapped my series x for a PS5.

Having not played a sony console in almost a decade, i was absolutely blown away by the wealth of content available on PS+/Sony Gamepass what ever you want to call it & then they even dropped the brand new horzion game on it last week.  Checked out Spiderman (PS5 Version) and was blown away by the visuals. Even though the series x is more powerful, i don't think I've seen a game look that incredible in a long time.

Recently, i just checked out the Resident Evil 4 Demo and OMFG, the adaptive triggers, the inbuilt mic speaker for Leon's communication, and the haptic vibration feedback. 
The bloody controller has blown me away. I had no idea how next gen it would actually feel compared to the xbox controller.

"I had no idea how ""Next Gen"" PS5 would actually feel.","I've been gaming since the Amiga/Nes/MS, so I really 'felt' the huge leaps inbetween generations.

I think the reason this Gen feels so much better is because the last gen (X1/PS4) was SOO lacklustre hardware wise.

Historically, when a console released, it's price/performance ratio was so good at launch that to get the equivalent on a PC you'd have to spend 3x as much. PS4/XB1 weren't much cheaper than an equivalent PC (at the time of release), while still having the limitations of being a console.

Oh...it's PCgamer.

I get the ""game in long dev let's moan about it"" but like...

what I read here is:

""Game so deep in alpha that they don't even have seamless server movement in an MMO yet has a rocky alpha patch""...

Like, who gives a fuck, the game doesn't even have a good portion of foundational tech required to build the actual game off of yet. If you are expecting a smooth game in an DEEP alpha videogame that's ridiculous. They have no reason to release a polished version of any patch when they are still ripping the code apart at a foundational level.

If you want a PLAYABLE...FUN....game, how about avoiding games in ACTUAL FUCKIN ALPHA. It's ridiculous, what has happened to the consumer industry of gaming where gamers expect ALPHAs to be stable and playable and fun? Have we become this stupid? We don't know what words mean?

We've already established the game is a development shitshow with big dreams and the slowest growth record in history due to bad management calls (surprise surprise Chris Roberts was surrounded with yes men and his head up his ass)...I don't see how THIS patch is worth a headline, maybe if it was actually a major patch like 4.0 or w/e they've been advertising for 7 years that still hasn't arrived because the 10 other major layers of tech required to deliver it still aren't finished.

Imo, this is a problem with the ""games as a service"" pipeline. If you want REAL growth, if you want REAL development...you can't be balancing out the entire fuckin game for a live audience to play it flawlessly every fuckin minor patch.

Look at EVERY major game as a service. The ONLY way you see massive growth is reboots. Major foundational changes to gameplay cannot be implemented in a game where players expect quarterly content updates that are stable and bugless. Whereas the only major GaaS titles started with enough content day one that the only new adds are just playable content...and not systemic. Maybe UI changes.

Whereas, from what Im reading, 3.18 changed the ENTIRE CODE BASE OF THE FOUNDATION OF THE GAME....so that placed objects persisted on the server until players trash them/store them in a void/or the server has to cull. That's not an easy feat.

Im sorry, this era of game dev has to fuckin die. I get the idea that it allows indie devs to produce unique content...but when MAJOR companies are doing this shit it gets old.

Star Citizen has just been around so long and growing so long that we forgot it started out as an indie with NO production company to even make it...just a dude with a pitch.",-3,0,52,52,,52,magvadis,PrinceDizzy,0

Bungie’s old gem that needs a modern remake,"This was the first time a game took over my life. I lived and breathed this game. From high school, using the free demo that allowed you to spawn copies and play for free on LAN, in the computer lab after school, all the way through college. When I left for college, the computer I brought with me had to have the specs to play Myth II at high settings, that was my only concern haha. When I was busy with school stuff, I would still sign in and hang out in lobbies chatting with my clan mates. Used to call it the most expensive chat program I ever bought. I even played on a team for the Myth World Cup in 2001. And when Bungie made the microsoft deal and sold the IP to TakeTwo, I followed the development of Myth III, made by MumboJumbo games, very closely. (and was very disappointed hah).

What game didn't actually need the hero's intervention?,"Interesting... This is more of a story telling question. Depending on how you frame the story, you get different answers. Is Indiana Jones the story of how the Nazi's were prevented from obtaining and unleashing a powerful weapon? Or is it the life story of a college professor, including both his failures and victories?

1. If the point of the story is to explain how we got from point A to point B, or how one side achieved victory and the other defeat, the individual agents can seem insignificant. You can convince yourself that without the ""hero,"" things would have ended up the same, or maybe even better! If the hero had not made mistakes, the villain never would have been a threat to begin with! So the hero was never needed, right? The destination would have been the same or better without them!



2. If the point of the story is to explore a certain character and their life, witness their flaws and strengths, mistakes and growth, the hero is ALWAYS essential. In this case, the historic outcome isn't what's most important. What is important is that this protagonist tried, and failed, and grew, and the story is focused around the individual journey, NOT the destination. Who cares if things would have turned out the same without them? The point is they were there, and their life journey is interesting.",6,0,16,16,"Talking to friends, we were discussing movies where the hero wasn't needed at all.

"Microtransactions don’t cost credits, coins, gems, etc. They cost money!","They often purposely blur the lines by making small amounts of the microtransaction currency free to get by playing, and having different exchange rates depending on how much you buy

Its extra blurred in games like GTA Onine because you can actually earn a very good amount without spending real life money, if I buy a super car for 5m dollars that I earned from hiests why would I convert that to how much it would cost me to buy that with real money instead?

Look at Sea of Thieves Item store. That's how it should be done! You can earn some ancient coins in game and you can buy them sure thing. But if you're unsure on what a skin coats exactly you can switch out the in-game currency for real currency. So how know exactly what that item costs.

I'd be super happy if they would allow you the direct purchase of that item for that exact amount instead of going kver ancient coins but that's world's better than what were mostly seeing.

"Microtransactions don’t cost credits, coins, gems, etc. They cost money!","I think I'll probably get skinned alive for this opinion, but as an adult I am able to make conscious and informed decisions about my spending. With that in mind, I'm really not bothered by microtransactions. If it is something that I am interested in, I will weigh the cost vs. what I'm receiving and determine if I'm comfortable with the price. If I'm not, I don't buy it. If I am, I will. 

Giving the option to buy things is not the issue. No one is forcing you to buy skins, or battle passes, or anything. If someone is spending irresponsibly that is a personal lesson they need to learn.

Firstly, if an item cost $5, but lowest bundle of currency you can buy is $10? No the item is still $5, because you **DO** get $5 of credit left, which you can use for another purchase, it doesn’t just disappear. Otherwise the next time a $5 item come up are you going to say it is free?

Also it is perfectly fine to use credit as UoM. Because people **CAN** be F2P players, who earned credits and won’t even spend a penny in the game, for those people, it is pointless for them to use money as UoM, as they won’t be spending anything at all.",1,0,30,30,"Just a reminder that the various virtual currencies used by free to play games are made up nonsense and everything in the game costs actual money.

Interesting story as well. And I also liked that Alfre cursed and joked while exploring and fighting. It actually felt like a real 21yo NYC girl got transported to another world. It would have felt weird if she acted any different. I felt it was other characters like Auden and Pilo who were annoying at times and antagonist towards Frey.
Only real complaint I have is that I’ll admit the story could have been fleshed out just a bit better with improved pacing.

I would not trade any console for a PS5 at this point. Even for purely monetary gain, the PS5 is good to sell to buy games on other platforms NOT to have as a gaming console. There's a lot of buzz about those Back Buttons on the $200 version of the DualSense.... so? My PS4 has those. Paid $10 for the Back Btn Attachment. But still, there's NO games that make me ""have to have it"". That's unacceptable for being a 3 year old console. PS4 had many must have games on day 1. PS3 only took a year. 3 years for PS5 and still no killer apps.",1,0,3,3,"I'm trying to convince my nephew to get ps5 for various reasons that aren't important.

So rented final fantasy 7, and then rented it again and again. I fell in love with rpgs and realized games could meaningful stories with messages in them.

Going 45-0 with a shotgun in COD MW (2019), which was especially awesome because I am shit at competitive FPS games... I've never done anything close to that again.

Seeing and beating every boss in Enter the Gungeon and Nuclear Throne. Those games are so fucking hard, but it was so worth it. I can basically run them with my eyes closed now.

"I’m considering a steam deck. For those of you who own one, how do you like it?","It entirely depends on YOU. If you already game on a pc/have plenty of time to game, then no its not worth it in any way.

If you travel a lot, or don't have time to play due to school, kids, ect, then its 100% worth it especially given the competition. I played mine at work when there was nothing else to do.

It can run almost any game at a consistent 30 fps, including some emulation (you can even play switch/wii u games on it)

  
Its battery life is ass if you're playing AAA games, so you'll want a battery pack or a place to plug it in; the charger it comes with is pretty much the only type that will charge it well. Also keep in mind that it uses a linux based OS so some games like Dead By Daylight are literally unplayable on it unless you install windows (which massively shortens the battery life span)

&#x200B;

"I’m considering a steam deck. For those of you who own one, how do you like it?","It's a very versatile little box that has yet to show its full potential imo.

The functionality of the thing is great, and it's not locked like a handheld console is so you can install a different OS if you want.  If you're tech savvy you can make almost anything work on it.

It's great if you like handhelds.  The battery life isn't spectacular.  If I fire up Elden Ring it says I have 2-3 hours of battery life.  Some games you can turn down the settings, screen brightness, turn on airplane mode, limit the hardware, and I've seen it say I have another 6-8 hours left.

I think it mostly depends on you and your wants.  For me it's simply a gaming tablet or something with a controller built in.  I put SO MANY HOURS into my 3ds, this is just an upgrade without 3d.

I mostly got one so I could bring it places and plug it in, so battery life isn't super important unless I'm away from power.  If you're planning to get hours and hours of portable gaming, might not be the best.

Also if you're in a spot where you can just get a desktop, that's probably the better choice, but you can get a USB hub or the steam dock and plug in a monitor, keyboard, mouse, extra controllers, whatever peripheral you want.

I love it personally as I can play outside, let a friend borrow it, remote play, etc.  I love the dual trackball feeling touch pads, and the 4 extra triggers.  Everything is so easily customizable.  I of course spent days when I first got it just seeing what I could get to work, as im the kind of gamer to put hours into modding skyrim only to finally get it to work and never play again.  The steam deck has a super great user friendly UI, but its essentially a gaming PC or laptop more than a console.",2,0,8,8,"What’s the beefiest game you play on it successfully?

"I’m considering a steam deck. For those of you who own one, how do you like it?","I got a Steam Deck shortly after they came out and honestly, I am still let down by it. Here is my honest opinion: 

It can play **most** games available on Steam rather well. The “beefiest” game I’ve played on it is Borderlands 3…. And it was clunky at best. It really depends on the types of games you wish to play. If you find yourself playing more FPS or highly polished AAA story games like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War… I should leave those to proper gaming consoles. But, if you prefer slower paced games that aren’t as graphically heavy, like Civilization 6 or Inscryption, then the Steam Deck will work well.

In terms of model, I have the middle value version which costs about $600 at the time. The main reason I got it was for the bump up in graphics and it had an integrated SSD. But at that price, you can now get a PS5 which has a lot more to offer. So… honestly, it’s not worth the current price tag. 

I have not modified mine at all, nor do I plan to. 

In conclusion: The Steam Deck is **great** for gaming on the go that is one of the only selling points for it… but if you plan to do most of your gaming while at home or plan to play mostly FPS games or highly polished AAA titles I would invest in a proper gaming PC or PS5. 

Lastly, with the middle-value option at around $600, you may be better off spending that same amount of money on a PS5 which will offer a lot more. 

Again, this is just my personal opinion and experience with the system. Other people may have differing thoughts. 

I hope this was informative at least. Good luck!",3,0,8,8,"What’s the beefiest game you play on it successfully?

Just remember that it had a highly troubled development. It was rushed, key members of the team left in the middle of of project, and then it was abandoned before they did any DLC to try and add more substance to the game.

Personally, I enjoyed the hell out of it. And with the legendary edition of the trilogy out now, it's definitely worth playing after you finish ME3. Previous commenters have already said it's a spin off, and they are 100% correct. If it didn't have the shadow of the original trilogy hanging over it, I think it would have had a much better overall reception as a standalone game.",4,0,5,5,"Ive played Mass Effect 1,2 and 3 and love them

Should I play Omori?,"Omori is a masterpiece, but it's also VERY intense in its themes of depression, self-harm, and suicide. If you're sensitive about those issues, I'd probably just watch them on YT.

"I never get why AAA studios think ""more live service"" is really a selling point anymore","I don't mind them if done right.

Get a good base game, then get more of that game every few weeks for free? Sounds good to me.

The problem is all the ones I've played failed to deliver on the free content after launch

Avengers and Anthem were both great games at their core. General gameplay was fun, story campaign was good, combat was great, but once you finished the story there was nothing left to do and the content updates got so delayed, or were so bad, that I got bored.

I love the idea of new content every few weeks, it's like getting a new small game every month or so. Like right now I don't have any games to play, but I have 2 games coming out in a month, so it'd be nice to have something I could just jump into without having to dedicate myself to a full game.

I don't mind ""the grind"" if the game is fun. Plus most games I get (usually single player games) I play through once then never touch again, so it's nice to have a game that isn't over in 2 - 3 weeks

Battle passes... Honestly don't have a lot of experience with them, but they didn't seem bad in avengers. You do some stuff you'd do anyway and get new skins and other items, seems fine to me? Most the rewards were crap so I never bothered with them. Not sure how they work in other games, but if it's similar I don't get the hate.

The only issue I'd have on any of this is pay to win stuff, and yeah thats usually is a part of live service pvp games, but it's not required that all live service games have that.

Is it just me that didn’t enjoyed this game ? . How are your experience with this game,"My experience with the game:

Booting up the day after live on GamePass - ""This looks cool, Soulslikes are hit-or-miss for me, but this has NPC companions like Code Vein and I loved that, so it's worth a shot.""

Opening cinematic - ""Hey, neat!""

Character creation - ""Hell yeah, this is awesome! Lemme spend a hour or so tweaking until this guy's perfect, gonna be playing them for a while...""

Gameplay - ""Ok, looks a little dated but no biggie. Counter system is a little wonky, a little hard to not dodge by accident... Oh, it's another pc death in 1-2 hit jankness. Once I level a bit should be fine..""

Tiger demon - ""What's this 10 levels above me bs? How are you... Oh, gotta run around and kill the same guys 3-4 times in order to over level morale to stand half a chance. Boring ass grind loop, great...""

After 3-4 loops, maxing morale and getting to stage boss. - ""Ok that was pointless and boring, but cool cinematic, now to fi.... And I'm dead. His morale's half of mine and I died in 2 hits. Okay, I'll get him ne.... Nevermind, did it again. Okay, this time I.... Goddammit.""

Repeat 8-10 times over the course of a couple of days until - ""Finally! Yes! Now I can.... SECOND PHASE!!?? He's the beginning... And dead again. Ok fine, I got past.... Back to phase one? Motherfu....""

Rinse and repeat until present day.

Edit - A couple other thoughts during play:

""Well, this kill-respawn-farm loop is boring as hell but at least I'm leveling up.... Oh, that does basically nothing. Well shit, I guess equipment is key then.""

""Sweet, new armor! This'll help... And now I can't dodge or counter, wtf?... So I have to put points into that to use armor, so it's purely detrimental without level focus..""

""Ok, guide said block to avoid health damage! I'll get him this... And now I'm stunned. And now dead. Maybe I didn't do it right.... Nope, stunned and dead again. One more... I DIDN'T EVEN TAKE A STEP!!!""

""His timing's all wierd, it keeps changing. Maybe if I download instead of playing on Cloud.... No, now it's WORSE!""",18,0,0,0,,0,sarethatraeus,bracessaw,0

Is it just me that didn’t enjoyed this game ? . How are your experience with this game,"Not as good as Nioh 2 but very entertaining; combat is as good as you would expect from Team Ninja, after you get the hang of it. 

First boss is supposed to be annoying, it teaches you most of the mechanics. There are a couple of really well done bosses later on, and some really annoying ones.

Level design is a mediocre as usual with too many dark level, when the good look alot better in the day. Story makes a bit more sense that previous games. Loot system feels weird - there not as many drops as Nioh, but most of weapons and armors feel like garbage. And the system in Nioh 2 where you level up based on how much you use a weapon was cooler; and weapons overall were more fun.

Overall 7/10, I enjoyed it, but play Nioh 2 first.",2,0,0,0,,0,nustiuboss,bracessaw,0

Is it just me that didn’t enjoyed this game ? . How are your experience with this game,"Stuff I didn't like.

Way too much loading. Every level takes about 20-30 seconds to load. I'm on a 5000MB/s SSD. You finish a level then load into the hub then load again into the next level. They didn't need this hub area, they could have just done it like they did in Nioh with a 2D map and menu.

Doesn't seem to be any point to using light weapons. The bigger the better. You parry and hit enough to build up spirit then unleash a spirit attack. With heavy weapons a fully charged spirit attack does more damage and spirit damage which means you're going to land those fatal strikes sooner.

Marking flags like Kodama can be placed in some very awkward places and you'll need equipment that will mark it on your minimap if you're not using a guide to find them. Which means you'll spend a lot of time looking at the minimap than the actual game.

The other collectibles cannot be tracked. You don't know in which level you have collected the golden bugs, pandas or scrolls.

You can't buy or in some way generate upgrade materials. I ran out of the low tier materials very quickly and there was no way to get them but to go back to the early game levels and grind them out.

That sub mission where you fight the 3 generals is BS. For the entire game you are taught to aggro the least amount of enemies to avoid getting surrounded and then it throws this at you. It's just you repeatedly finding ways to cheese the AI untl you find one that works.

To get the reinforcement guys 4 star gear you need to level them up to 10 but you can't do that unless you take them on missions. I wanted to do the game solo but I had to take these reinforcement dudes to get their gear.

The 4th to last boss (dragon lightning guy) was the hardest boss in the game while the 3rd to last boss (armored tank turtle guy) was the easiest in the game. The boss balancing is all over the place. The guy who makes multiple clones of himself was also annoying to deal with.

On the Steam forums I see a lot of posts about how some people cannot get past the first boss. While I didn't have much of a problem with him he is on the upper end of the difficulty level when it comes to bosses which really shouldn't be as far as first bosses go.

They wanted to make Sekiro with a Nioh flavour but never put much thought into blending these 2 games in a coherent way.",1,0,0,0,,0,Mr_Phishfood,bracessaw,0

"I just recently started using a mouse and keyboard on my PS5 and I got me wondering what everyone else is using, so do you prefer a controller or a mouse and keyboard and why?","It depends on the type of game for me but I'm predominantly MKB. Third person and racing games I prefer controller because the movement of the characters feels more immersive with controller and racing seems more accurate/responsive with controller. I can't slightly turn with a keyboard as a press of A or D is a lot more aggresive than slightly tilting the controller. 

FPS games are MKB all day every day because I'm far more accurate with it and I can do quick flicks without having to deal with joystick acceleration and what not. Plus aim assist is for baddies especially in games like COD where the aim assist on controller is essentially an aimbot. The tracking is unreal now. 

On top of that, having more keys to map actions to is a god send. I hate how in certain games, 1 key/button is mapped to a bunch of different actions and it actually gets in my way.",2,0,2,2,,2,crazzyazzy,Marc051,0

I would love for there to be more musical RPGs. This is the intro of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure (1998 PS1),"Rhapsody is a charming game with a whole bunch of great ideas and some really botched execution. The story completely tapers off at about three hours in, the dungeons are confusion copy-paste and the battle system is pretty awful. It also feels a little mean to say but, Rhapsody would have benefit from having more engaging music and choreography. The musical interludes should take place at major story points, but instead they're just kind of lightly sprinkled in at seemingly random times.

Yet the idea of a musical RPG that really targets young girls as a demographic is pretty much a perfect pitch. Straight women represent potentially a little under half of the games market and yet developers seem stubbornly resistant to actually produce content for this group. 

If Rhapsody just had less dungeon crawling, some social sim elements and a more cohesive story I think it'd be hailed as a classic and would have been a profoundly influential game.",3,0,4,4,,4,Negative-Squirrel81,njstein,0

Valheim,"I played it for 30 minutes last night before bed and here is what I (think) I figured out.

You unlock new crafting recipes by simply picking up new materials. So pick up a rock and some wood and you'll learn how to make an axe.

If punching trees does nothing then you're punching a tree that's too big, you can definitely punch thinner trees and branches for wood. Stones appear on the ground and flint will appear in or near water.

The tutorial bird reappeared a few times for me, not sure what caused it but after I wandered away from those totems and came back the bird had new info for me.

Other than that I assume you're literally just supposed to wander around collecting materials, so you unlock more crafting recipes, so you can build a house with more crafting options, so you can build better weapons, take on a boss then rinse and repeat in a new biome.",6,0,0,0,"I’ve just installed Valheim on my XSX and… am I losing the plot?

Games with cool and fun utility spells,"I came here to say Sun Haven, but you beat me too it.

Vaccuumulus can be used in combat. It can also clear weeds without harvesting plants.",1,0,0,0,"To be clear, I mean OUT of combat utility.

One of my favorite things in gaming is when you unlock a spell or ability that expedites regular mundane activities or otherwise turns them into something fun that you look forward to. Stuff like all those ""filler"" spells in DnD that create feasts and clean the kitchen after, or create a temporary house or what have you. There's a lot of cool potential in these types of spells but I VERY rarely see games dabble in this type of thing, usually reserving magic as almost entirely combat/healing based.

Some examples

1. Forespoken - Say what you will about the game, but the Burrow spell was something I didn't know I needed in my games until I got it. They took it a step further and had it reduce other cooldowns as well making it useful in combat as well as outside of it. (for those who don't know, the spell creates vines that burrow away from the PC and will automatically collect all loot within a certain radius, and it reduces the cooldown of your other support spells proportionate to the amount of loot gathered).
2. Sun Haven - Has a ton of spells that expedite the farming/mining in the game, such as a spell that mines all rocks in an area around you, creates earthquakes to till the soil and rain clouds to water crops, all VERY cool, thematic and just feel good to use.
3. Skyrim WITH mods - Not gonna list them all, but base skyrim had the spell that guides you to your objective, which was basically useless given the compass, but MODDED skyrim added a tone of cool utility spells, check out Apocalypse and Ordinator's magic supplements for some cool stuff like that.

That's about all I can think of off the top of my head, so if anyone has any other suggestions for games with a decent amount of this type of thing please let me know!",0,brian11e3,shiek200,0

It's really crazy how they managed to make a whole-ass MMO work on a console. The controller shortcuts for chatting, the way the menus work so you can browse your menu while still running around, the lobby system, everything. It was so mindblowing to have a console-based MMO, and PSO did a great job. It felt impossible to have a game like this on a console.

My family ended up putting in a second phone line for me so I could play PSO without disrupting the household, because I'd play for hours and hours. And now I'm playing it, handheld, wirelessly.

The Red Dead mural I painted in my childhood bedroom 10+ years ago is getting torn down today.,"RIP John.

Around 2012, I moved back in with my parents after graduating college. It was time to give my childhood bedroom a renovation, so I decided to paint John Marston from my favourite video game of all time on my bedroom wall.

I moved out on my own shortly after, and my parents is finally renovating the entire house since we first moved in 30+ years ago. Construction starts today, and my bedroom wall is getting knocked down and turned into one large master bedroom for my parents.

It's sad to see John go, this mural was my first ever post on reddit, and it will forever hold a special place in my heart. Posting this final photo of the mural here to commemorate the occasion, the beginning and the end.

I was always jealous of my friends that had Mario 64. I finally beat it at 33y/o,"To be fair, you had quite a few chances.

First, the DS remake, in which not only was the console cheaper, but the game was too.

Then there's the Wii, which everyone and their mother owned, that had Mario 64 for $10.

Then there's the 3DS, which runs DS games, Mario 64 included.

The Wii U also had it.

And now I assume you beat it on the Switch, but if you did so through NSO+, the it's safe to assume that you previously let go of yet another chance with the 3D All-Stars collection.

They make sure you give up any and all consumer rights they are allowed by law to talk you out of.... and no one ever gets any traction on how and why that shouldn't be the way of things. 

And it doesn't look like that's going to change, which is a good part of the reason I'm slowly leaving the domain as an entertainment value proposition and, frankly, is why MMOs can't get more than transient market anymore.

No one believes that you can keep more than single player experiences (saves) because the industry kind of taught us that's how it will always be.

Metal Gear Solid franchise - Obvious choice if you like Kojima's writing. You'll need a PS3 if you wanna play the entire franchise.

Final Fantasy VII Remake - highly recommend playing original first if you have no issue with turn based combat. The Remake has more of an action combat system.

The PS2 Prince of Persia trilogy - Not as polished gameplay wise as the PS2 God of War titles, but certainly worth playing and has a good story as well.

Devil May Cry - Not as story-driven but I'm sure you'll still enjoy those games based on your picks.

Bioshock franchise: Intriguing worlds with philosophical and thought provoking stories. (Might not fit based on your picks, but I love the games you listed and I also love Bioshock so I thought I'll throw it in there).",1,0,0,0,"1. NieR: Automata. I finished Replicant.

Game Suggestions Please,Borderlands 3,2,0,0,0,"Hi All,

My buddies and I got into Fortnite after work during the pandemic and we have fallen off big time regarding consistently hopping on and playing together. We have been discussing that we are all ready for a new game and want something more relaxing. Over our discussion, we have concluded that we are looking for a 4-player campaign or pve type of game that we can enjoy casually and outside of the popular BR format. We tried sea of thieves this week and unfortunately I got super seasick lmfao. 

General Specifications:

\- Ideally cross platform, we have 2 on xbox, 1 on pc, and 1 on ps5

\- PvE or Campaign style game no BR

We have tossed around titles like Destiny 2 but my hesitation is that I've heard destiny 2 is an insane grind and can feel very repetitive. Minecraft also comes to mind but that would take some convincing as the guys are all 27+ and have never tried minecraft. Honestly if a game like Dragon Age Inquisition had a 4 player cross platform campaign that would be exactly what I think we would enjoy. Heck, we would be on 2K23 or FIFA right now running a group franchise or campaign right now if they had cross-platform.

Let me know if there are any games out there that would work. Any thoughts are appreciated",0,TheHappiestJew,plow_poon,0

What are your top 5 or 10 games/series that you want brought back or remade?,I want them to turn Paper Mario back into an RPG,6,0,0,0,"These are my top 10, in no particular order...

* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 1 & 2
* Tenchu: Stealth Assassin
* Metal Gear Solid 1-4
* Condemned: Criminal Origins & Bloodshot (esp in VR!)
* Splinter Cell
* Syphon Filter
* Silent Hill 1 & 2
* Jade Empire (one of old school Bioware's best games)
* Fear Effect (unique, adult PS1 game that was 4 discs lol)
* Dino Crisis

I can think of a few others I'd love to be remade but those are probably my top 10. Some others I'd love to see brought back or remade would be the Driver series, Black (one of the best shooters on Xbox/PS2 and way ahead of its time), NFS Underground 2, the Killzone series, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, Def Jam: Fight for New York (probably the most fun I ever had playing a fighting game & the music was great), Fable series, Parasite Eve, Beyond Good & Evil (weren't we supposed to get a sequel ages ago?), Shenmue, Fight Night series, Star Wars: Jedi Outcast and The Force Unleashed, Half Life series, Prince of Persia, GTA: San Andreas/Vice City and Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. So those are all the games that I believe are deserving of being brought back into the current generation or deserve remakes of the original games, if not entirely new games. 

I can't even imagine how sick the Condemned games would be in VR, they're literally *perfect* for it; first person melee combat, horror, creepy af atmosphere and cool detective/investigation mechanics. And I can't imagine how amazing Dino Crisis or Fear Effect could be with today's graphics and tech. So I'm curious what everyone else thinks are games deserving of being remade, and could actually be successful. Like I'd love a remake of Indigo Prophecy or Wild 9 but I know they likely wouldn't be commercially successful so I didn't even put em on the list. I'm hoping this post blows up and some game devs see it and recognize how much money could be made with remakes of some of these titles. Tenchu, KotOR, MGS, Silent Hill and Splinter Cell would all pretty much be guaranteed cash cows imo. Anyway, thanks for coming to my Ted Talk!",0,Drew1848,James_Skyvaper,0

What are your top 5 or 10 games/series that you want brought back or remade?,You've got great taste my man. I'd play any of those games  remastered.,1,0,0,0,"These are my top 10, in no particular order...

* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 1 & 2
* Tenchu: Stealth Assassin
* Metal Gear Solid 1-4
* Condemned: Criminal Origins & Bloodshot (esp in VR!)
* Splinter Cell
* Syphon Filter
* Silent Hill 1 & 2
* Jade Empire (one of old school Bioware's best games)
* Fear Effect (unique, adult PS1 game that was 4 discs lol)
* Dino Crisis

I can think of a few others I'd love to be remade but those are probably my top 10. Some others I'd love to see brought back or remade would be the Driver series, Black (one of the best shooters on Xbox/PS2 and way ahead of its time), NFS Underground 2, the Killzone series, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, Def Jam: Fight for New York (probably the most fun I ever had playing a fighting game & the music was great), Fable series, Parasite Eve, Beyond Good & Evil (weren't we supposed to get a sequel ages ago?), Shenmue, Fight Night series, Star Wars: Jedi Outcast and The Force Unleashed, Half Life series, Prince of Persia, GTA: San Andreas/Vice City and Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. So those are all the games that I believe are deserving of being brought back into the current generation or deserve remakes of the original games, if not entirely new games. 

I can't even imagine how sick the Condemned games would be in VR, they're literally *perfect* for it; first person melee combat, horror, creepy af atmosphere and cool detective/investigation mechanics. And I can't imagine how amazing Dino Crisis or Fear Effect could be with today's graphics and tech. So I'm curious what everyone else thinks are games deserving of being remade, and could actually be successful. Like I'd love a remake of Indigo Prophecy or Wild 9 but I know they likely wouldn't be commercially successful so I didn't even put em on the list.

I try to mix it up, rts, survival, survival horror, horror. It's good to mix it up, I can't play cod online anymore because these people only paly that shit 12 hours a day every day.

What's it called when a game takes you away from a usually safe place?,"a twist

So, by taking you away from a ""usually safe place"" i mean taking actions that you do regularly on a game and turning them into enemy encounters or something along the lines of that.

And i don't mean just jumpscares or ambushes (Like for example in The Last Of Us, you open lots of doors and sometimes opening a door triggers a staged scene or something like that, but i dont consider that as a ""safe place""), i mean things like crafting benches or save stations (also safe zones, but i cant think of any example of this), two examples are TLOU 2 and Dead Space 1, on TLOU 2, i was recently shown by a friend that if you start crafting at a certain crafting bench, you [get ambushed](https://youtu.be/i4ez9uGGRq4?t=70), and in Dead Space 1 (2008), a very similar thing happens, only that an enemy [falls behind you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOo1OtaLwA&ab_channel=Walkthrough%21Database) and its more of a jumpscare (with the music and all), so yeah, anyone know the name of this ""concept""? i just love it when they do stuff like this in games, it keeps the gameplay fresh and makes you keep an eye out the whole time, does anyone else agree with me or do you guys not really care for this kind of stuff?

Otherwise!


Do you want the biggest fight in the whole game? This is what I did, on my first visit. 


Load a game from before the first visit to the Institute.
Shoot the... old man (do iiit!), immediately after he is done talking. Just blast that head off!

Shoot everyone, clearing out the Institute (when you play this for real, there are lots of quests here, no matter which faction you will chose to side with, so this is just for fun).

Go back towards your portal. 

Now, the fun begins!
See that red line filling up the front of your compass? Bad guys aplenty are waiting! Save!

I charged right up to them, blasted off three nukes up the stairs (quicklaunch ftw!) aaaand... my computer froze. 

I sat there in disgust, sipping my coffee, wondering if I should go to bed to get three hours of sleep, or play more and then go to work, when there was a movement!
It was like I'd stepped forward... an inch. 
Then, another. 
My exp-meter jumped a bit.... after my computer was done, calculating all that damage dealt, things were happening;

I leveled up. And again. And again. 10 levels! I would NOT have survived that fight without backpedaling throughout the complex, I thought!
After wading through the bodies, I reloaded to try to fight them.
And save, just for the hell of it.


That, or give in to your inner demon and fight them. That fight was so much fun!


Well, then you need to reload, erasing all that, but I hoped that at least the old man knew what I did... before letting him walk away.
If nothing else, it's a great way to see if those highest settings will be a smooth ride for the rest of the game. I didn't have any lags, except for that big booom, but it was like running into a brick wall, my cpu later said.",2,0,13343,13343,,13343,EvulOne99,sirbalz,0

**EDIT**: This definitely turned into a ramble of sorts, so if you're not really interested in that, save yourself the 3-4 minutes, because the general gist of it all is ""Life is too short to not enjoy.""

***

It's Blizzard, so I've learned to be cautious, anymore.  I want to be positive and have faith that they didn't/wont screw it up, but fool me twice, yano?

The gameplay has looked to slow down the pace a ***lot*** and I dont know if that is actually the case, or if they've just shown off slower bits (early gameplay/skills) and so we dont see a Cuisinart of carnage ripping through hordes of enemies.

I was really expecting that if I picked the game up, I'd definitely dive head-first into Barbarian.  In concept, I really like the 'Arsenal' system with the Barbarian, but to me it seems very sluggish.  Now there is definitely something to be said about deliberate gameplay, but Since D2 where the game's popularity exploded, the game has had a certain cadence to it when you get to endgame, and without that level of celerity, I feel like a facet of the franchise (or even of the genre on the whole) might be lost.

I love everything about the systems that we as players will get to interact with, and I think the decisions that they made re: itemization have been absolute bangers -- one thing I am not worried about in D4 is itemization, and that is such a massive part of the genre, that it really could carry it most of the way, (if the game just picks up its pace even a little as we progress to and through endgame).

I've had the page open to purchase it all week, and I've been in conflict, as I haven't supported Blizzard in years, and a purchase now would taste of hypocrisy, and there isnt a mouthwash that gets that vile flavor out.  

But on the other hand, we only get so long on this planet, and if there is something that might bring even a spark of joy to this (typically) otherwise oppressive existence, then why shouldnt we seize any opportunity to nurture that spark into a flame?  Something to keep us warm as we stay a while and listen to the story being told.

I dunno.  This turned into a bit of a ramble, and I apologize.

I really hope this game is good, for my sake, sure, in the event I do pick it up -- but also for everyone who is definitely going to be playing it.",-1,0,0,0,What the title says!,0,GreedyDiceGoblin,Crazy_Canuck78,0

What happens if Xbox acquires Activision/Blizzard/King?,"Microsoft seems to be interested spreading to all platforms except Sony's. It has made a deal with GeForce Now and Boosteroid to bring it's games to their services and of course they made a deal with Nintendo too. To me it looks like MS can't make their console business to work well and they look into the future(cloud gaming and being everywhere). 

Selling consoles isn't that good business anyway, it's selling games where the money is and that is MS's plan. 

Sony will keep dominating the console sales and MS won't probably even try to compete with that, because they don't have to.

What happens if Xbox acquires Activision/Blizzard/King?,"Personally I think it will benefit the gaming industry. 

In terms of Xbox and their fan base it’s a win deal in terms of Xbox game pass and the games that will come to the platform. 

In the last couple of weeks Microsoft have signed deals with other platforms and I think it will benefit everyone as it means bringing more games to more players which equals more money for them companies so it can only benefit the gaming industry.

Regarding Sony I don’t see it doing much harm to them at all. I highly doubt Microsoft would do something as stupid as make COD or any other ABK game exclusive to just Xbox as it’s not really the business model from Microsoft they tend to be more about getting as many people playing games in many different platforms such as mobile (and this deal does that with the acquisition of king) and Microsoft would lose so much money by cutting off PlayStation from having access to them games.

I've spent the past 4 years developing a [board game](https://i.imgur.com/tRl5dlk.jpg) that attempts to capture my love of Final Fantasy turn based combat. It was a long design journey (Which you can read more about [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3036539/design-journey-encounters-shattered-wastes)), but I ended up with something that I think really captures the essence of what I love about the classic 16-bit style of Final Fantasy.

My game [Encounters: Shattered Wastes is now on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/almanacgames/encounters-shattered-wastes), and I wanted to share it here, because it's one of the few places I think will really appreciate it.

Hard AF. The experience point system made it the only Zelda game that required grinding, which lets all admit, isn't fun whatsoever. It also is probably the only Zelda that had as much ""twitchy"" video game stuff in it. The side scrolling portions were more Castlevania than Zelda, but less fun than Castlevania. It was a ""big"" game, but the graphics weren't very good. Pretty repetitive, even for NES games. Enemies didn't really change, they just became faster, required more hits to kill, or gained additional attacks. Which was likewise repetitive. 

I look back on this game fondly, but it definitely isn't one that I'd revisit anytime soon. It is a ""good"" game, but far from the best Zelda game. It is definitely unique in the series, if for game play and the story if nothing else.",20,0,570,570,,570,PHATsakk43,Pale_WoIf,0

I still go back and watch old trailers for MGS4 and MGS5. They're so well done, and the trailers for MGS5 turned me on to the songs featured in them.

I can safely say mine was when I found out that Konami and Kojima split. Because I knew full well that there will never be another true Metal Gear Solid game released again like the ones I spent my entire childhood enjoying. They might release some weird spin offs, some pachinko machines, maybe even a remake(please). But we will almost certainly never get another sequel in the series unless some crazy shit happens and Sony buys out Konami and gives Kojima full rights to MGS under his studio.

"I miss Metal Gear Solid. Like, a lot.","Eh, I don't know. I feel like the franchise ran its course and even Kojima didn't know what to do with it. Like it was obvious that Kojima and the crew really had no idea what to do after the first game and got lucky with 2 and 3.

MGS4 is such a weird game though. Like it's obviously very well made and has more production value and effort put into it than 95% of video games released since.

It's apparent that Kojima really felt the need to wrap up the incoherent mess of a story he created with the last third of Metal Gear Solid 2 despite having no idea how to wrap it up and it really doesn't work out as MGS4 put way too much focus on the presentation of this incoherent mess of a plot and what gameplay that was actually there suffered as a result. I never even bother to play MGS5 as I was just kind of done with the series after 4.

Metal Gear Rising on the other hand really kicks ass. Nit only is it actually possible to understand the admittedly much simpler story, but the gameplay absolutely kicks ass and is a fun time all the way through. It's easily my favorite Metal Gear game and I'd much rather have a Rising 2 than a MGS6.",2,0,859,859,"Especially the original trilogy of games.

"I miss Metal Gear Solid. Like, a lot.","So happy to see a post about MGS gain traction and randomly pop up on my front page.

Everyday I dream that I will be watching some gaming event, maybe its E3, maybe its the Game Awards or who knows, and after one of the showcases end it cuts to a black screen… and a slowly fading “…kept you waiting, huh?” creeps in and we see a new Metal Gear game.

Unfortunately with how things ended with Kojima having to go solo and not being allowed to use what was literally his IP, it looks like we may never get anything again, unless Konami for some reason brings it back after the failure of Metal Gear Survive. 

Most people would even tell you that there isn’t any more Metal Gear content to be made, that the story line is already complete and we have nothing else to explore. My opinion, it’s a fictional world, you can do anything. I’d love to see the older games completely remade in modern engines and graphics pushing even the limits of MGSVTPP, a game that was already well ahead of its time, but thats just my pipe dream, it will never happen…. unless…",1,0,859,859,"Especially the original trilogy of games.

MGS4 and MGSV have specific issues that people have and their stories rely a lot more on the other games of the series, but they are still amazing games.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/gaming) if you have any questions or concerns.*",1,0,3,3,"As I wrap up a 300-hour journey through these two games -- one that started in November last year, but in reality started years earlier -- I find myself drawn to comparisons to Baldur’s Gate (BG1) and Baldur’s Gate II (BG2). You have two games using a well-loved system (Pathfinder 1st edition) in a real-time with pause (RTWP) engine with a not quite isometric camera. In the first you have that feeling of fresh-faced adventure and wandering a world to encounter new challenges just like BG, while the sequel has a far more focused approach which pushes you ever forward, along with a chapter where the world opens up and a ton of side-quests appear in your log, just like BG2.

These games were subject to successful Kickstarter funding campaigns, though given their production positioning them as AA games, there was clearly publisher money involved at some point. I also wonder if those campaigns aren’t the reason for some of the problems I’ll get into.

I bounced off Kingmaker (KM) a number of times, spending almost 70 hours across multiple playthroughs which never made it past act 1. Yet I kept coming back as the game offers a compelling world to explore. I'd also heard great things about Wrath of the Righteous (WoTR), particularly its mythic path system, so wanted to play that.

I’ve been playing CRPGs for decades, all the way back to Bard’s Tale. Yet it was Bioware’s Baldur’s Gate that gave me an obsession for the genre, teaching me that the kind of games I loved were shared adventures with interesting characters. I got obsessed enough with that series that I worked on the [Ascension]( https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/quests/ascension/) mod for Throne of Bhaal because I wasn’t ready to let go. Since then, CRPGs have dominated my gaming, through companies like Bioware, Obsidian, CD Projekt RED, Harebrained Schemes, and Bethesda.

Both KM and WoTR are so clearly inspired by BG series everything that came out of the Infinity Engine. While the Pillars of Eternity games were presented as nostalgia tributes to the Infinity Engine games, these feel much closer to those games, both for good and bad, and a large part of that is the Pathfinder system.

# Pathfinder

I won’t pretend to be an expert in this, but Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) had a controversial 4th edition, with concern from fans that it was a gross simplification driven by trends in the online RPG space. This led to the Pathfinder system, a fork of AD&D 3.5, which has itself had its own controversy with its 2nd edition.

Both KM and WoTR are based on the 1st edition and are great examples as to why the system is nicknamed Mathfinder.

These games reflect my first experience with the system.

# My setup

I played KM as a neutral good Ranger at Challenging difficulty, and WoTR as a neutral (dipping in and out of evil) Slayer at Core difficulty. In KM I felt Challenging should be well suited to someone with Infinity Engine experience, and also someone who had played Act 1 multiple times now. I chose Core in WoTR as that was the minimal level for numerous achievements and therefore a level where I hoped the game would punish me for lazy play, but not require the kind of hardcore optimisation of higher difficulties.

If I had to pick an example of perfect difficulty, it would be Dragon Age Inquisition at Insane difficulty. Encounters would sometimes take a couple of tries, but almost never more than two, and after every loss I could always identify the mistake **I** had made, and correct it. Anything outside the difficulty curve was optional and clearly marked, and no big spikes hit me at any time. That game had its problems, but it has the best difficulty curve I've found in a CRPG.

# Overview

Kingmaker has a strong opening act, and it’s one of the reasons I kept coming back. It introduces all the systems, and not just the combat ones, but also how skills will be used for dialogue checks, and how decisions can have consequences. Part of what was so exciting about act 1 were the various party combinations you could emerge from the tutorial with, or how the order you visit things on the world map can change how encounters play out. I went to a tomb expecting a particular encounter, only to find because I’d done things in a different order the tomb was empty and looted. It keeps things fresh, and both games keep this feeling of consequence throughout, with decisions you made coming back to influence characters and events. The conclusion of one companion quest near the end of KM had their decision partly influenced by a decision I made in the tutorial. Amazing stuff.

Both games also have cool text adventure portions. If you're familiar with such from Pillars of Eternity it's just like that, but running for longer, and occurring far more regularly. Honestly, they make much better use of it than Pillars did. I was more of a fan of the presentation in KM, especially the line art style, but text adventures were always a welcome break in both.

These are games of high highs and low lows, really the extremes are kind of incredible. At their peak you’re partaking in some epic dialogues, seeing how decisions you made earlier have shaped this scene, or perhaps even caused it to happen whereas it won’t for other players. You know that the choices you make are having a huge impact on your game to come. At their lowest moments you’re stuck manging a not so mini mini-game or bashing your head against yet another difficulty spike.

WoTR might be one of the best choice & consequence games of all time. You have multiple “mythic paths”, and each has huge chunks of content that are unique to them. While this is a systems driven game, I actually made what felt like a suboptimal choice in taking the Demon mythic path, but felt like the right narrative choice for my adventure. That choice went on to shape every relationship I had, and completely changed the tone of my game. And that’s just one of six options available to you! It’s an unbelievable level of effort, in part made possible by the minimal voice acting and much heavier reliance on text.

However, the games have a few really big problems.

# Combat

This is where the slavish adherence to Pathfinder becomes a problem. It’s a system designed for tabletop sessions, where someone can just as viably create themselves a master of non-combat elements as combat. But these games are packed full of combat encounters, and non-combat skills are just something you max out across the party without a thought. So long as someone in the party knows religion you’re good, doesn’t matter who.

The issue with combat is that you make next to no interesting decisions. 49% of combat is build, which will often involve decisions made tens of hours ago, another 49% is pre-buffing, and then only 2% is decisions in combat. The way things play out is you carefully build characters to max key stats, build synergies, and get equipment that compliments all this. That’s really cool. But then you reach a map, you run through your pre-buff routine (and later on you’ll have 40-50 effects on each character), and then you lawn mower the map. Offensive spells are next to worthless because there are too many encounters, so you derive infinitely more value from buffs. Cleanse the map, then go back and loot everything when it doesn’t matter if the buffs run out.

Buffing was so critical in WoTR that I ended up installing [a mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/195) to do it at the press of a button as I was beginning to dread enemies just for the five minute buff routine it would entail. Pre-buffing is not something I’ve missed in my CRPGs.

# Encounter design

In KM act 1 you encounter a campsite where everyone is dead, but you can rest. In this region there are warring mites and kobolds. However, they weren’t a danger to me as I had convinced both I was their ally, hence I’m safe to rest. Hah! Nope, some death skull spawns and murders you. How were you supposed to know that would happen? That’s the neat part, you don’t! And the games are packed with stuff like this where you’re steamrolling some area, then a murder monster appears and slaps you down.

Another classic is 99% of the time when you spot a monster, the game then auto-pauses so you can do what you need to do, except for the 1% of the time where it instead cutscenes you into range before you can do anything. Thanks, game!

Among KM players, just hearing about the House at the Edge of Time is enough to trigger traumatic flashbacks. I have to agree with them, that is peak Owlcat bullshit.

There are two aspects which make all this more frustrating than it needs to be.

## The combat log is shit

At the start you’ll think the combat log is good. It shows die rolls, breaks them down, you can see where most stuff comes from. Nice. Then you start to level up, and it doesn’t scale at all. By the end of WoTR you’ll be generating hundreds of lines every round, and a round is six seconds long. Good luck finding out why your archer missed in the middle of all that.

The log is in desperate need of a filter, and without one it’s an unusable nightmare. In the final battle of WoTR I couldn’t find how to counter what the boss had done, because they cast multiple area-of-effect spells in a battle with 15 combatants, generating hundreds of entries, and that’s not including the hundreds I was generating simultaneously. In that final battle I also stumbled into the discovery that I had completely underestimated the power of a certain ability because delving into the log was such a nightmare I’d never noticed before.

It’s also not very accurate. At times you will see damage being assigned to someone who already died. Sometimes checks are just missing and it’s not clear why. Other times you will see some number that has no item or feat source, leading to you tearing your hair out trying to figure out why a companion is doing more damage than you thought they would. If all you know is their name you’ll have to trawl through 40 feats, 40 buffs, and 20 items to figure out which one is doing the thing.

The mechanics are also overwhelming. I’m not sure even the designers understand how it all fits together. Even at the end of my 300 hours I was discovering ways the system works I hadn’t known. Something I didn’t notice until late for example was that each ability applied on an attack isn’t handled as part of the weapon’s attack damage, and that this then leads to certain effects being exponentially useful because while you’re ostensibly applying them to the weapon, they get applied to each effect. Then perhaps you have something which causes certain attacks to happen multiple times. So now that 2d6 bonus you applied is suddenly 10d6. Nothing in the game will tell you this, you have to stumble across it in the logs, and this is just one example!

The log simply isn’t fit for purpose.

UI in general is a problem with the games. Playing without a mod which allows you to buff at the press of a button is like indulging in self-flagellation.

## Combat is too easy to prepare you for when it isn't

If you build well and always apply your buffs you should be able to get through most combats without having to step in. Maybe you adjust targeting order, or split the archers to take out the backline while your frontline holds up the enemy. But what this means is when the game throws some nightmare encounter at you you're slamming into a wall without the education to know how to scale it. This is on the critical path.

Just as bad was when an enemy appeared that required a completely different toolset to beat than anything else present, especially frustrating when it's bosses with immunities to everything you used to get through the dungeon up until this point. Even when you are in a position to change the party, or overhaul your spell set, it felt like a tedious slog rather than a meaningful challenge. The game never gives you any indication of what threat you’ll face at any location, so you always bring the 99% effective party and spell composition. KM isn’t as bad, as most of these types of encounters exist in their own area and so you leave and come back later, but WoTR loved to do this mid-dungeon. One dungeon locks you in, and if you brought the wrong party for its challenge, you better hope you’ve got an earlier save.

This was one of my biggest sources of frustration throughout both games.

There’s also the mess of turn-based versus RTWP. In KM a well-regarded mod was put out with a turn-based setup. It’s actually a much better way to get a handle on how combat is working than RTWP allows for, but is also completely unsuitable for a game of this scale. WoTR has turn-based built-in, and this leads to the Arcanum problem of how do you balance for both? You can’t. The best example of this are swarms, where in RTWP a bunch of tics or locusts are the deadlier than any demon lord, but in turn-based are absolutely no threat whatsoever. Owlcat need to pick their poison and balance around it, you shouldn’t be seeing posts recommend switching to turn-based to beat certain encounters. I am relieved to see that their next game, Rogue Trader, will be turn-based only.

# Slavish adherence to systems which don’t belong in a computer game

The encounter design necessitates quick save since you never know when you’re going to stumble into some murder encounter. However, quick save undermines other systems. If you failed to pick a lock you need to come back when you've increased your skills. Disarming a trap comes with the danger of triggering it. Except neither of these things are true because the game has quick save.

The real issue is that there is no reward for failure. Triggering a trap doesn’t lead to some new, interesting outcome, you just take a bunch of damage that will make things harder, and harder in this game usually just means longer. There’s no incentive to let such failures stand and you will save before every trap, every chest, and reload if you fail. There needs to be a better way, either through designing for failure, or switching to a Boolean system.

My favourite example is in WoTR if you fail certain skill checks then time passes. Time passes causes all your buffs to run out. Without those buffs you’re under-powered for the area. This necessitates a rest and then re-buff. Or are you simply going to reload your save from before the skill failure? There’s no reason to accept the failure. In tabletop this means the party has to adapt and the dungeon master adjusts the scenario accordingly, but in a computer game it’s just a waste of your time.

And it's odd, because the game does have some interesting failures. For example, at one point you might choose to renounce a mythic path for another, yet some third-party tries to stop you, leading to a skill check. Pass, and you change path, fail and you stick to your original. Neither route is wrong, so failure is perfectly acceptable and leads to an outcome that is both narratively and mechanically interesting. I want more of that, please.

# Dreadful not so mini games

Both games feature ill-advised strategic games that sit above the CRPG layer. Both serve as undesired interruptions to the cool CRPG you’re playing. KM’s is heavily reliant on die rolls you have little control over and almost necessitates quick load to avoid getting randomly screwed with failure leading to a spiral of doom as failure begets failure. WoTR’s is just a tedious chore and is what if Heroes of Might & Magic 3 (HOMM3) but shit, and I didn’t much like HOMM3 in the first place. Honestly, WoTR feels like it has the overland travel simply because KM did, despite the fact that there's very little to discover out there.

Both have the same issue where nothing on the strategic level really impacts the CRPG aspect, so it’s hard to care about any of it. The only times either work is when you get the more traditional throne room scene where you make key decisions via dialogue. These allow for cool character expression, both by yourself and your companions. It feels more like running a kingdom/crusade than anything that happens on the strategic map.

Had they been limited to assigning advisors and throne room scenes then they’d have been good, and indeed the way different advisors in KM can play out is cool, but generally these modes are just a massive time sink that represent a good 15% of your play time. You can’t ignore them either because you can lose the game in this mode, and at least in KM certain powerful items are tied to quest lines which are tied to this.

# A problem with endings

Sadly, both games share a problem, and that’s the ending. In recent years CRPGs have begun to understand the importance of the denouement, and CD Projekt RED is a prime example of this with both Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 having deeply satisfying send offs. Meanwhile, WoTR has one of the least satisfying and most jarring endings I’ve ever encountered, where the final boss fight concludes then you’re immediately dumped into some very short slides and the game ends.

Owlcat need to trim some of the fat from their games and scale back their plans. Both KM and WoTR are clearly running out of steam towards the end. In KM the maps you unlock near the end have far less locations to explore, while in WoTR the reactivity starts to fall apart with key events not being commented on by individuals who absolutely would have something to say. You can even sacrifice your life and your love interest won’t have a word to say about it.

For all the replayability of WoTR, I went from “can’t wait to experience this journey again” to “meh” because the destination is just that unsatisfying. Slides are a poor way of presenting an ending at the best of times, and this is one of the worst uses of them I’ve seen to date. It’s not only that it’s jarring, it’s that the slides are so slight. While it’s not Mass Effect 3 bad, it did leave me with a sort of empty feeling, and not in the good way an epic EPG can. WoTR is actually a step back from KM in this regard, which had more detail and reactivity in its slides, though both really need an epilogue piece.

Both games have secret endings, and while I don't know much about the WoTR one, I went into KM prepared. I did every quest, I completed every kingdom research item. The one time I could just feel I'd picked a bad dialogue option with the antagonist that was taking me off the path, I reloaded. Then, right at the end, I found I couldn't get the secret ending because 50 hours earlier a secret die roll had happened without me knowing and I'd failed a check. This is the Owlcat design philosophy in a nutshell, and makes me wonder why they combine this with such long games.

# Despite it all I love these games

It’s the unabashed ambition most of all. KM gives you that feeling of BG1 where you’re exploring the land, stumbling upon cool encounters. WoTR has some of the best choice & consequence stuff I’ve ever seen in a CRPG, and begs for you to replay it.

I love the mechanical stuff. It’s intimidating as hell, and I almost always stuck to single class, but figuring out how to try and optimise your build, put together cool synergies, and then see it tear through enemies, never gets old. Even as I came to the end of each game I was thinking how I’d do things differently next time.

My primary love for CRPGs though isn’t systems based, it’s narrative. I want a world packed with people I care about. It’s why I was along for the ride when Bioware started to trim the fat in the Mass Effect games, and why CD Projekt RED is my current favourite RPG company.

KM, despite being touted as a narrative CRPG is actually lighter than you might expect. The comparison to BG1 & BG2 earlier wasn’t an accident. It’s not BG1 light, but you can see in WoTR that Owlcat have gained more confidence and experience in putting this stuff together. The companions are more interesting, do more to defy expectations in their arcs, and the romance choices are far more interesting. I could do without my 160 hour CRPG allowing me to tank a romance through one bad dialogue choice, but Bioware didn’t master this overnight either. And the romances are a breath of fresh air if you found Bioware stuff fairly milquetoast.

I can't give Owlcat enough credit for their writing of evil characters. They're not treated as one-note, or cackling idiots, rather they have their own world views which are treated as seriously as anything else. A favourite of mine in WoTR is Regill, your Hellknight companion who embodies the philosophy of victory through discipline, and as he tells one character, ""The forces of good are not weak, it's just you."" He's labelled as lawful evil because of his philosophy, but he sees himself one of the good guys. And the game is packed with characters like this. And this equally applies to being evil yourself, where you can pursue paths of lust, or power, or ambition, or ""the greater good"", rather than just being a dick. I haven't had this much fun playing evil since Dragon Age Origins, and the warden who had yet to meet the demon he wouldn't do a deal with.

What I also loved is how much variability I had in party composition, especially in KM. Generally in a CRPG I lock in my party and it never changes, but here I had real options, and the game provided me with the equipment necessary to keep everyone viable. In KM I left one companion at a ford for a long time because I couldn’t be bothered to change up my party, yet by the end of the game they’d become a key part of my personal story and I felt a close, personal connection to them.

WoTR hits some incredible highs. When you’re standing before demon lords and gods and making choices that you know will shape the entire story to come, well that’s just CRPG heroin to me. The game hits these sorts of highs over and over and over again. So many epic moments, and I only wish it didn’t end in such a wet fart.

I know I dwelled far more on bad than the good, but ultimately if you enjoyed Infinity Engine games then you’re getting into something that is a natural evolution, while also keeping many of the flaws those games had too.

There has been much discussion over the years about wasted content, time spent making things a player will never see, and companies trying to avoid this. I'm glad Owlcat don't, because content I will never see is what allows me to have experienced *my* story rather than *the* story, and it makes the game mean so much more to me. The mistakes Owlcat make are also a reason for their strengths, because they haven't soaked in the prevailing wisdom of what you should and should not do, so why not make six completely different paths of the player? I'm glad of it, that someone out there is making this kind of game still.

I find myself with the realisation that Owlcat is the company Beamdog so desperately wanted to be.

# So which should you play?

WoTR is the better game, no two ways about it. The companions are better developed, and the writers are good at defying expectations in how an arc should play out. The mythic path system really lets you shape your own story, and critically it’s a much tighter story than KM’s episodic feel.

Yet I’d say KM is the better first game. WoTR has a more fleshed out tutorial, but it really doesn’t convey the stuff you need to know, and in the in-game encyclopaedia in both games are utter garbage, you will need to use Google. The enemies in WoTR require a better understanding of the systems, with all sorts of immunities and resistances among them. KM has more traditional CRPG monsters that act as you expect, and in one of the lone instances of resistances being important it dedicates multiple encounters and scenes to educating you on this. KM won’t Pathfinder you quite as hard as WoTR will, and WoTR also has a more brutal difficulty curve.

If you’re big on your CRPGs though, you should find time for both. Owlcat is a name that’s on the rise, and I will be buying anything they put out, or I will twelve months after they put it out. These are also very buggy games, even playing it more than a year after launch I didn’t get through a single WoTR session where I didn’t file a bug report. Maybe give it another year in the oven.

Whatever you play, crank up quick save and auto save slots to the maximum value, trust me.",3,AutoModerator,Quitchy,0
Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous – a love letter to the infinity engine,"Are you me?

I’ve replayed kingmaker act 1 three times now but after putting it down for a bit keep wanting to reroll a new char. I played BG1/2 when they were released so I’m familiar with the systems 

I just picked up WoTR on sale today from GoG, looking forward to it",1,0,3,3,"As I wrap up a 300-hour journey through these two games -- one that started in November last year, but in reality started years earlier -- I find myself drawn to comparisons to Baldur’s Gate (BG1) and Baldur’s Gate II (BG2). You have two games using a well-loved system (Pathfinder 1st edition) in a real-time with pause (RTWP) engine with a not quite isometric camera. In the first you have that feeling of fresh-faced adventure and wandering a world to encounter new challenges just like BG, while the sequel has a far more focused approach which pushes you ever forward, along with a chapter where the world opens up and a ton of side-quests appear in your log, just like BG2.

These games were subject to successful Kickstarter funding campaigns, though given their production positioning them as AA games, there was clearly publisher money involved at some point. I also wonder if those campaigns aren’t the reason for some of the problems I’ll get into.

I bounced off Kingmaker (KM) a number of times, spending almost 70 hours across multiple playthroughs which never made it past act 1. Yet I kept coming back as the game offers a compelling world to explore. I'd also heard great things about Wrath of the Righteous (WoTR), particularly its mythic path system, so wanted to play that.

I’ve been playing CRPGs for decades, all the way back to Bard’s Tale. Yet it was Bioware’s Baldur’s Gate that gave me an obsession for the genre, teaching me that the kind of games I loved were shared adventures with interesting characters. I got obsessed enough with that series that I worked on the [Ascension]( https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/quests/ascension/) mod for Throne of Bhaal because I wasn’t ready to let go. Since then, CRPGs have dominated my gaming, through companies like Bioware, Obsidian, CD Projekt RED, Harebrained Schemes, and Bethesda.

Both KM and WoTR are so clearly inspired by BG series everything that came out of the Infinity Engine. While the Pillars of Eternity games were presented as nostalgia tributes to the Infinity Engine games, these feel much closer to those games, both for good and bad, and a large part of that is the Pathfinder system.

# Pathfinder

I won’t pretend to be an expert in this, but Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) had a controversial 4th edition, with concern from fans that it was a gross simplification driven by trends in the online RPG space. This led to the Pathfinder system, a fork of AD&D 3.5, which has itself had its own controversy with its 2nd edition.

Both KM and WoTR are based on the 1st edition and are great examples as to why the system is nicknamed Mathfinder.

These games reflect my first experience with the system.

# My setup

I played KM as a neutral good Ranger at Challenging difficulty, and WoTR as a neutral (dipping in and out of evil) Slayer at Core difficulty. In KM I felt Challenging should be well suited to someone with Infinity Engine experience, and also someone who had played Act 1 multiple times now. I chose Core in WoTR as that was the minimal level for numerous achievements and therefore a level where I hoped the game would punish me for lazy play, but not require the kind of hardcore optimisation of higher difficulties.

If I had to pick an example of perfect difficulty, it would be Dragon Age Inquisition at Insane difficulty. Encounters would sometimes take a couple of tries, but almost never more than two, and after every loss I could always identify the mistake **I** had made, and correct it. Anything outside the difficulty curve was optional and clearly marked, and no big spikes hit me at any time. That game had its problems, but it has the best difficulty curve I've found in a CRPG.

# Overview

Kingmaker has a strong opening act, and it’s one of the reasons I kept coming back. It introduces all the systems, and not just the combat ones, but also how skills will be used for dialogue checks, and how decisions can have consequences. Part of what was so exciting about act 1 were the various party combinations you could emerge from the tutorial with, or how the order you visit things on the world map can change how encounters play out. I went to a tomb expecting a particular encounter, only to find because I’d done things in a different order the tomb was empty and looted. It keeps things fresh, and both games keep this feeling of consequence throughout, with decisions you made coming back to influence characters and events. The conclusion of one companion quest near the end of KM had their decision partly influenced by a decision I made in the tutorial. Amazing stuff.

Both games also have cool text adventure portions. If you're familiar with such from Pillars of Eternity it's just like that, but running for longer, and occurring far more regularly. Honestly, they make much better use of it than Pillars did. I was more of a fan of the presentation in KM, especially the line art style, but text adventures were always a welcome break in both.

These are games of high highs and low lows, really the extremes are kind of incredible. At their peak you’re partaking in some epic dialogues, seeing how decisions you made earlier have shaped this scene, or perhaps even caused it to happen whereas it won’t for other players. You know that the choices you make are having a huge impact on your game to come. At their lowest moments you’re stuck manging a not so mini mini-game or bashing your head against yet another difficulty spike.

WoTR might be one of the best choice & consequence games of all time. You have multiple “mythic paths”, and each has huge chunks of content that are unique to them. While this is a systems driven game, I actually made what felt like a suboptimal choice in taking the Demon mythic path, but felt like the right narrative choice for my adventure. That choice went on to shape every relationship I had, and completely changed the tone of my game. And that’s just one of six options available to you! It’s an unbelievable level of effort, in part made possible by the minimal voice acting and much heavier reliance on text.

However, the games have a few really big problems.

# Combat

This is where the slavish adherence to Pathfinder becomes a problem. It’s a system designed for tabletop sessions, where someone can just as viably create themselves a master of non-combat elements as combat. But these games are packed full of combat encounters, and non-combat skills are just something you max out across the party without a thought. So long as someone in the party knows religion you’re good, doesn’t matter who.

The issue with combat is that you make next to no interesting decisions. 49% of combat is build, which will often involve decisions made tens of hours ago, another 49% is pre-buffing, and then only 2% is decisions in combat. The way things play out is you carefully build characters to max key stats, build synergies, and get equipment that compliments all this. That’s really cool. But then you reach a map, you run through your pre-buff routine (and later on you’ll have 40-50 effects on each character), and then you lawn mower the map. Offensive spells are next to worthless because there are too many encounters, so you derive infinitely more value from buffs. Cleanse the map, then go back and loot everything when it doesn’t matter if the buffs run out.

Buffing was so critical in WoTR that I ended up installing [a mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/195) to do it at the press of a button as I was beginning to dread enemies just for the five minute buff routine it would entail. Pre-buffing is not something I’ve missed in my CRPGs.

# Encounter design

In KM act 1 you encounter a campsite where everyone is dead, but you can rest. In this region there are warring mites and kobolds. However, they weren’t a danger to me as I had convinced both I was their ally, hence I’m safe to rest. Hah! Nope, some death skull spawns and murders you. How were you supposed to know that would happen? That’s the neat part, you don’t! And the games are packed with stuff like this where you’re steamrolling some area, then a murder monster appears and slaps you down.

Another classic is 99% of the time when you spot a monster, the game then auto-pauses so you can do what you need to do, except for the 1% of the time where it instead cutscenes you into range before you can do anything. Thanks, game!

Among KM players, just hearing about the House at the Edge of Time is enough to trigger traumatic flashbacks. I have to agree with them, that is peak Owlcat bullshit.

There are two aspects which make all this more frustrating than it needs to be.

## The combat log is shit

At the start you’ll think the combat log is good. It shows die rolls, breaks them down, you can see where most stuff comes from. Nice. Then you start to level up, and it doesn’t scale at all. By the end of WoTR you’ll be generating hundreds of lines every round, and a round is six seconds long. Good luck finding out why your archer missed in the middle of all that.

The log is in desperate need of a filter, and without one it’s an unusable nightmare. In the final battle of WoTR I couldn’t find how to counter what the boss had done, because they cast multiple area-of-effect spells in a battle with 15 combatants, generating hundreds of entries, and that’s not including the hundreds I was generating simultaneously. In that final battle I also stumbled into the discovery that I had completely underestimated the power of a certain ability because delving into the log was such a nightmare I’d never noticed before.

It’s also not very accurate. At times you will see damage being assigned to someone who already died. Sometimes checks are just missing and it’s not clear why. Other times you will see some number that has no item or feat source, leading to you tearing your hair out trying to figure out why a companion is doing more damage than you thought they would. If all you know is their name you’ll have to trawl through 40 feats, 40 buffs, and 20 items to figure out which one is doing the thing.

The mechanics are also overwhelming. I’m not sure even the designers understand how it all fits together. Even at the end of my 300 hours I was discovering ways the system works I hadn’t known. Something I didn’t notice until late for example was that each ability applied on an attack isn’t handled as part of the weapon’s attack damage, and that this then leads to certain effects being exponentially useful because while you’re ostensibly applying them to the weapon, they get applied to each effect. Then perhaps you have something which causes certain attacks to happen multiple times. So now that 2d6 bonus you applied is suddenly 10d6. Nothing in the game will tell you this, you have to stumble across it in the logs, and this is just one example!

Owlcat need to pick their poison and balance around it, you shouldn’t be seeing posts recommend switching to turn-based to beat certain encounters. I am relieved to see that their next game, Rogue Trader, will be turn-based only.

My primary love for CRPGs though isn’t systems based, it’s narrative. I want a world packed with people I care about. It’s why I was along for the ride when Bioware started to trim the fat in the Mass Effect games, and why CD Projekt RED is my current favourite RPG company.

KM, despite being touted as a narrative CRPG is actually lighter than you might expect. The comparison to BG1 & BG2 earlier wasn’t an accident. It’s not BG1 light, but you can see in WoTR that Owlcat have gained more confidence and experience in putting this stuff together. The companions are more interesting, do more to defy expectations in their arcs, and the romance choices are far more interesting. I could do without my 160 hour CRPG allowing me to tank a romance through one bad dialogue choice, but Bioware didn’t master this overnight either. And the romances are a breath of fresh air if you found Bioware stuff fairly milquetoast.

I can't give Owlcat enough credit for their writing of evil characters. They're not treated as one-note, or cackling idiots, rather they have their own world views which are treated as seriously as anything else. A favourite of mine in WoTR is Regill, your Hellknight companion who embodies the philosophy of victory through discipline, and as he tells one character, ""The forces of good are not weak, it's just you."" He's labelled as lawful evil because of his philosophy, but he sees himself one of the good guys. And the game is packed with characters like this. And this equally applies to being evil yourself, where you can pursue paths of lust, or power, or ambition, or ""the greater good"", rather than just being a dick. I haven't had this much fun playing evil since Dragon Age Origins, and the warden who had yet to meet the demon he wouldn't do a deal with.

What I also loved is how much variability I had in party composition, especially in KM. Generally in a CRPG I lock in my party and it never changes, but here I had real options, and the game provided me with the equipment necessary to keep everyone viable. In KM I left one companion at a ford for a long time because I couldn’t be bothered to change up my party, yet by the end of the game they’d become a key part of my personal story and I felt a close, personal connection to them.

WoTR hits some incredible highs. When you’re standing before demon lords and gods and making choices that you know will shape the entire story to come, well that’s just CRPG heroin to me. The game hits these sorts of highs over and over and over again. So many epic moments, and I only wish it didn’t end in such a wet fart.

I know I dwelled far more on bad than the good, but ultimately if you enjoyed Infinity Engine games then you’re getting into something that is a natural evolution, while also keeping many of the flaws those games had too.

There has been much discussion over the years about wasted content, time spent making things a player will never see, and companies trying to avoid this. I'm glad Owlcat don't, because content I will never see is what allows me to have experienced *my* story rather than *the* story, and it makes the game mean so much more to me. The mistakes Owlcat make are also a reason for their strengths, because they haven't soaked in the prevailing wisdom of what you should and should not do, so why not make six completely different paths of the player? I'm glad of it, that someone out there is making this kind of game still.

I find myself with the realisation that Owlcat is the company Beamdog so desperately wanted to be.

# So which should you play?

WoTR is the better game, no two ways about it. The companions are better developed, and the writers are good at defying expectations in how an arc should play out. The mythic path system really lets you shape your own story, and critically it’s a much tighter story than KM’s episodic feel.

Yet I’d say KM is the better first game. WoTR has a more fleshed out tutorial, but it really doesn’t convey the stuff you need to know, and in the in-game encyclopaedia in both games are utter garbage, you will need to use Google. The enemies in WoTR require a better understanding of the systems, with all sorts of immunities and resistances among them. KM has more traditional CRPG monsters that act as you expect, and in one of the lone instances of resistances being important it dedicates multiple encounters and scenes to educating you on this. KM won’t Pathfinder you quite as hard as WoTR will, and WoTR also has a more brutal difficulty curve.

If you’re big on your CRPGs though, you should find time for both. Owlcat is a name that’s on the rise, and I will be buying anything they put out, or I will twelve months after they put it out. These are also very buggy games, even playing it more than a year after launch I didn’t get through a single WoTR session where I didn’t file a bug report. Maybe give it another year in the oven.

Whatever you play, crank up quick save and auto save slots to the maximum value, trust me.",3,Githzerai1984,Quitchy,0
Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous – a love letter to the infinity engine,i boght Kingmaker a while ago but really couldnt get into it. First time i went in blind and first thing was ther Berry picking mission with the swarm enemies. That was bullshit and i le t it rest for a while. After coming across a thread and reading a bit i gave the game a second try but i still couldnt really get into it. also the things i read about it like timed content and kingdom management etc it just turns me of a lot more i dont know. All i wanted is a good game to wait for BG3,1,0,3,3,"As I wrap up a 300-hour journey through these two games -- one that started in November last year, but in reality started years earlier -- I find myself drawn to comparisons to Baldur’s Gate (BG1) and Baldur’s Gate II (BG2). You have two games using a well-loved system (Pathfinder 1st edition) in a real-time with pause (RTWP) engine with a not quite isometric camera. In the first you have that feeling of fresh-faced adventure and wandering a world to encounter new challenges just like BG, while the sequel has a far more focused approach which pushes you ever forward, along with a chapter where the world opens up and a ton of side-quests appear in your log, just like BG2.

These games were subject to successful Kickstarter funding campaigns, though given their production positioning them as AA games, there was clearly publisher money involved at some point. I also wonder if those campaigns aren’t the reason for some of the problems I’ll get into.

I bounced off Kingmaker (KM) a number of times, spending almost 70 hours across multiple playthroughs which never made it past act 1. Yet I kept coming back as the game offers a compelling world to explore. I'd also heard great things about Wrath of the Righteous (WoTR), particularly its mythic path system, so wanted to play that.

I’ve been playing CRPGs for decades, all the way back to Bard’s Tale. Yet it was Bioware’s Baldur’s Gate that gave me an obsession for the genre, teaching me that the kind of games I loved were shared adventures with interesting characters. I got obsessed enough with that series that I worked on the [Ascension]( https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/quests/ascension/) mod for Throne of Bhaal because I wasn’t ready to let go. Since then, CRPGs have dominated my gaming, through companies like Bioware, Obsidian, CD Projekt RED, Harebrained Schemes, and Bethesda.

Both KM and WoTR are so clearly inspired by BG series everything that came out of the Infinity Engine. While the Pillars of Eternity games were presented as nostalgia tributes to the Infinity Engine games, these feel much closer to those games, both for good and bad, and a large part of that is the Pathfinder system.

# Pathfinder

I won’t pretend to be an expert in this, but Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) had a controversial 4th edition, with concern from fans that it was a gross simplification driven by trends in the online RPG space. This led to the Pathfinder system, a fork of AD&D 3.5, which has itself had its own controversy with its 2nd edition.

Both KM and WoTR are based on the 1st edition and are great examples as to why the system is nicknamed Mathfinder.

These games reflect my first experience with the system.

# My setup

I played KM as a neutral good Ranger at Challenging difficulty, and WoTR as a neutral (dipping in and out of evil) Slayer at Core difficulty. In KM I felt Challenging should be well suited to someone with Infinity Engine experience, and also someone who had played Act 1 multiple times now. I chose Core in WoTR as that was the minimal level for numerous achievements and therefore a level where I hoped the game would punish me for lazy play, but not require the kind of hardcore optimisation of higher difficulties.

If I had to pick an example of perfect difficulty, it would be Dragon Age Inquisition at Insane difficulty. Encounters would sometimes take a couple of tries, but almost never more than two, and after every loss I could always identify the mistake **I** had made, and correct it. Anything outside the difficulty curve was optional and clearly marked, and no big spikes hit me at any time. That game had its problems, but it has the best difficulty curve I've found in a CRPG.

# Overview

Kingmaker has a strong opening act, and it’s one of the reasons I kept coming back. It introduces all the systems, and not just the combat ones, but also how skills will be used for dialogue checks, and how decisions can have consequences. Part of what was so exciting about act 1 were the various party combinations you could emerge from the tutorial with, or how the order you visit things on the world map can change how encounters play out. I went to a tomb expecting a particular encounter, only to find because I’d done things in a different order the tomb was empty and looted. It keeps things fresh, and both games keep this feeling of consequence throughout, with decisions you made coming back to influence characters and events. The conclusion of one companion quest near the end of KM had their decision partly influenced by a decision I made in the tutorial. Amazing stuff.

Both games also have cool text adventure portions. If you're familiar with such from Pillars of Eternity it's just like that, but running for longer, and occurring far more regularly. Honestly, they make much better use of it than Pillars did. I was more of a fan of the presentation in KM, especially the line art style, but text adventures were always a welcome break in both.

These are games of high highs and low lows, really the extremes are kind of incredible. At their peak you’re partaking in some epic dialogues, seeing how decisions you made earlier have shaped this scene, or perhaps even caused it to happen whereas it won’t for other players. You know that the choices you make are having a huge impact on your game to come. At their lowest moments you’re stuck manging a not so mini mini-game or bashing your head against yet another difficulty spike.

WoTR might be one of the best choice & consequence games of all time. You have multiple “mythic paths”, and each has huge chunks of content that are unique to them. While this is a systems driven game, I actually made what felt like a suboptimal choice in taking the Demon mythic path, but felt like the right narrative choice for my adventure. That choice went on to shape every relationship I had, and completely changed the tone of my game. And that’s just one of six options available to you! It’s an unbelievable level of effort, in part made possible by the minimal voice acting and much heavier reliance on text.

However, the games have a few really big problems.

# Combat

This is where the slavish adherence to Pathfinder becomes a problem. It’s a system designed for tabletop sessions, where someone can just as viably create themselves a master of non-combat elements as combat. But these games are packed full of combat encounters, and non-combat skills are just something you max out across the party without a thought. So long as someone in the party knows religion you’re good, doesn’t matter who.

The issue with combat is that you make next to no interesting decisions. 49% of combat is build, which will often involve decisions made tens of hours ago, another 49% is pre-buffing, and then only 2% is decisions in combat. The way things play out is you carefully build characters to max key stats, build synergies, and get equipment that compliments all this. That’s really cool. But then you reach a map, you run through your pre-buff routine (and later on you’ll have 40-50 effects on each character), and then you lawn mower the map. Offensive spells are next to worthless because there are too many encounters, so you derive infinitely more value from buffs. Cleanse the map, then go back and loot everything when it doesn’t matter if the buffs run out.

Buffing was so critical in WoTR that I ended up installing [a mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/195) to do it at the press of a button as I was beginning to dread enemies just for the five minute buff routine it would entail. Pre-buffing is not something I’ve missed in my CRPGs.

# Encounter design

In KM act 1 you encounter a campsite where everyone is dead, but you can rest. In this region there are warring mites and kobolds. However, they weren’t a danger to me as I had convinced both I was their ally, hence I’m safe to rest. Hah! Nope, some death skull spawns and murders you. How were you supposed to know that would happen? That’s the neat part, you don’t! And the games are packed with stuff like this where you’re steamrolling some area, then a murder monster appears and slaps you down.

Another classic is 99% of the time when you spot a monster, the game then auto-pauses so you can do what you need to do, except for the 1% of the time where it instead cutscenes you into range before you can do anything. Thanks, game!

Among KM players, just hearing about the House at the Edge of Time is enough to trigger traumatic flashbacks. I have to agree with them, that is peak Owlcat bullshit.

There are two aspects which make all this more frustrating than it needs to be.

## The combat log is shit

At the start you’ll think the combat log is good. It shows die rolls, breaks them down, you can see where most stuff comes from. Nice. Then you start to level up, and it doesn’t scale at all. By the end of WoTR you’ll be generating hundreds of lines every round, and a round is six seconds long. Good luck finding out why your archer missed in the middle of all that.

The log is in desperate need of a filter, and without one it’s an unusable nightmare. In the final battle of WoTR I couldn’t find how to counter what the boss had done, because they cast multiple area-of-effect spells in a battle with 15 combatants, generating hundreds of entries, and that’s not including the hundreds I was generating simultaneously. In that final battle I also stumbled into the discovery that I had completely underestimated the power of a certain ability because delving into the log was such a nightmare I’d never noticed before.

It’s also not very accurate. At times you will see damage being assigned to someone who already died. Sometimes checks are just missing and it’s not clear why. Other times you will see some number that has no item or feat source, leading to you tearing your hair out trying to figure out why a companion is doing more damage than you thought they would. If all you know is their name you’ll have to trawl through 40 feats, 40 buffs, and 20 items to figure out which one is doing the thing.

The mechanics are also overwhelming. I’m not sure even the designers understand how it all fits together. Even at the end of my 300 hours I was discovering ways the system works I hadn’t known. Something I didn’t notice until late for example was that each ability applied on an attack isn’t handled as part of the weapon’s attack damage, and that this then leads to certain effects being exponentially useful because while you’re ostensibly applying them to the weapon, they get applied to each effect. Then perhaps you have something which causes certain attacks to happen multiple times. So now that 2d6 bonus you applied is suddenly 10d6. Nothing in the game will tell you this, you have to stumble across it in the logs, and this is just one example!

The log simply isn’t fit for purpose.

UI in general is a problem with the games. Playing without a mod which allows you to buff at the press of a button is like indulging in self-flagellation.

## Combat is too easy to prepare you for when it isn't

If you build well and always apply your buffs you should be able to get through most combats without having to step in. Maybe you adjust targeting order, or split the archers to take out the backline while your frontline holds up the enemy. But what this means is when the game throws some nightmare encounter at you you're slamming into a wall without the education to know how to scale it. This is on the critical path.

Just as bad was when an enemy appeared that required a completely different toolset to beat than anything else present, especially frustrating when it's bosses with immunities to everything you used to get through the dungeon up until this point. Even when you are in a position to change the party, or overhaul your spell set, it felt like a tedious slog rather than a meaningful challenge. The game never gives you any indication of what threat you’ll face at any location, so you always bring the 99% effective party and spell composition. KM isn’t as bad, as most of these types of encounters exist in their own area and so you leave and come back later, but WoTR loved to do this mid-dungeon. One dungeon locks you in, and if you brought the wrong party for its challenge, you better hope you’ve got an earlier save.

This was one of my biggest sources of frustration throughout both games.

There’s also the mess of turn-based versus RTWP. In KM a well-regarded mod was put out with a turn-based setup. It’s actually a much better way to get a handle on how combat is working than RTWP allows for, but is also completely unsuitable for a game of this scale. WoTR has turn-based built-in, and this leads to the Arcanum problem of how do you balance for both? You can’t. The best example of this are swarms, where in RTWP a bunch of tics or locusts are the deadlier than any demon lord, but in turn-based are absolutely no threat whatsoever. Owlcat need to pick their poison and balance around it, you shouldn’t be seeing posts recommend switching to turn-based to beat certain encounters. I am relieved to see that their next game, Rogue Trader, will be turn-based only.

# Slavish adherence to systems which don’t belong in a computer game

The encounter design necessitates quick save since you never know when you’re going to stumble into some murder encounter. However, quick save undermines other systems. If you failed to pick a lock you need to come back when you've increased your skills. Disarming a trap comes with the danger of triggering it. Except neither of these things are true because the game has quick save.

The real issue is that there is no reward for failure. Triggering a trap doesn’t lead to some new, interesting outcome, you just take a bunch of damage that will make things harder, and harder in this game usually just means longer. There’s no incentive to let such failures stand and you will save before every trap, every chest, and reload if you fail. There needs to be a better way, either through designing for failure, or switching to a Boolean system.

My favourite example is in WoTR if you fail certain skill checks then time passes. Time passes causes all your buffs to run out. Without those buffs you’re under-powered for the area. This necessitates a rest and then re-buff. Or are you simply going to reload your save from before the skill failure? There’s no reason to accept the failure. In tabletop this means the party has to adapt and the dungeon master adjusts the scenario accordingly, but in a computer game it’s just a waste of your time.

And it's odd, because the game does have some interesting failures. For example, at one point you might choose to renounce a mythic path for another, yet some third-party tries to stop you, leading to a skill check. Pass, and you change path, fail and you stick to your original. Neither route is wrong, so failure is perfectly acceptable and leads to an outcome that is both narratively and mechanically interesting. I want more of that, please.

# Dreadful not so mini games

Both games feature ill-advised strategic games that sit above the CRPG layer. Both serve as undesired interruptions to the cool CRPG you’re playing. KM’s is heavily reliant on die rolls you have little control over and almost necessitates quick load to avoid getting randomly screwed with failure leading to a spiral of doom as failure begets failure. WoTR’s is just a tedious chore and is what if Heroes of Might & Magic 3 (HOMM3) but shit, and I didn’t much like HOMM3 in the first place. Honestly, WoTR feels like it has the overland travel simply because KM did, despite the fact that there's very little to discover out there.

Both have the same issue where nothing on the strategic level really impacts the CRPG aspect, so it’s hard to care about any of it. The only times either work is when you get the more traditional throne room scene where you make key decisions via dialogue. These allow for cool character expression, both by yourself and your companions. It feels more like running a kingdom/crusade than anything that happens on the strategic map.

Had they been limited to assigning advisors and throne room scenes then they’d have been good, and indeed the way different advisors in KM can play out is cool, but generally these modes are just a massive time sink that represent a good 15% of your play time. You can’t ignore them either because you can lose the game in this mode, and at least in KM certain powerful items are tied to quest lines which are tied to this.

# A problem with endings

Sadly, both games share a problem, and that’s the ending. In recent years CRPGs have begun to understand the importance of the denouement, and CD Projekt RED is a prime example of this with both Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 having deeply satisfying send offs. Meanwhile, WoTR has one of the least satisfying and most jarring endings I’ve ever encountered, where the final boss fight concludes then you’re immediately dumped into some very short slides and the game ends.

Owlcat need to trim some of the fat from their games and scale back their plans. Both KM and WoTR are clearly running out of steam towards the end. In KM the maps you unlock near the end have far less locations to explore, while in WoTR the reactivity starts to fall apart with key events not being commented on by individuals who absolutely would have something to say. You can even sacrifice your life and your love interest won’t have a word to say about it.

For all the replayability of WoTR, I went from “can’t wait to experience this journey again” to “meh” because the destination is just that unsatisfying. Slides are a poor way of presenting an ending at the best of times, and this is one of the worst uses of them I’ve seen to date. It’s not only that it’s jarring, it’s that the slides are so slight. While it’s not Mass Effect 3 bad, it did leave me with a sort of empty feeling, and not in the good way an epic EPG can. WoTR is actually a step back from KM in this regard, which had more detail and reactivity in its slides, though both really need an epilogue piece.

Both games have secret endings, and while I don't know much about the WoTR one, I went into KM prepared. I did every quest, I completed every kingdom research item. The one time I could just feel I'd picked a bad dialogue option with the antagonist that was taking me off the path, I reloaded. Then, right at the end, I found I couldn't get the secret ending because 50 hours earlier a secret die roll had happened without me knowing and I'd failed a check. This is the Owlcat design philosophy in a nutshell, and makes me wonder why they combine this with such long games.

# Despite it all I love these games

It’s the unabashed ambition most of all. KM gives you that feeling of BG1 where you’re exploring the land, stumbling upon cool encounters. WoTR has some of the best choice & consequence stuff I’ve ever seen in a CRPG, and begs for you to replay it.

I love the mechanical stuff. It’s intimidating as hell, and I almost always stuck to single class, but figuring out how to try and optimise your build, put together cool synergies, and then see it tear through enemies, never gets old. Even as I came to the end of each game I was thinking how I’d do things differently next time.

My primary love for CRPGs though isn’t systems based, it’s narrative. I want a world packed with people I care about. It’s why I was along for the ride when Bioware started to trim the fat in the Mass Effect games, and why CD Projekt RED is my current favourite RPG company.

The companions are more interesting, do more to defy expectations in their arcs, and the romance choices are far more interesting. I could do without my 160 hour CRPG allowing me to tank a romance through one bad dialogue choice, but Bioware didn’t master this overnight either. And the romances are a breath of fresh air if you found Bioware stuff fairly milquetoast.

I can't give Owlcat enough credit for their writing of evil characters. They're not treated as one-note, or cackling idiots, rather they have their own world views which are treated as seriously as anything else.

 COOL ARMORS ARE NOT COOL BECAUSE THEY SHINE OR LOOK LIKE A PLASTIC FIGURE OF A POWER RANGER'S ENEMY.",1,0,0,0,I've got a really good foundation for a turn-based roguelike game but I've kind realize the original idea I had in mind kinda just sucks.

After playing it for a while it starts to feel like a crime that other games dare to put large monsters into their game worlds and then don't give you an option to climb them. I'm shocked it's not the standard since the game came out, really.

I absolutely adore how you need to handle each enemy type according to their weaknesses, and how it is things you would expect from a basic understanding of typical ""monster lore"" or common sense. It annoys me that modern games are too cowardly to have enemies that can (basically) only be defeated in certain ways, like the ghosts or living armor.",14,0,8941,8941,,8941,LevelStudent,PenetratorGod,0

Theres an ability that lets you cast a ball of energy that when you hit it, sends magic homing missiles at enemies…

You can combine these abilities and make and insane auto turret that will shoot everything that enters and everything around. Melts large enemies that step foot near you. 

You can also enchant both abilities with whatever affinity you have or put on your weapon.

"The fact that you could visit Kanto in pokemon silver was mindblowing back then, still amazing","For those that have never played pokemon games before.

Pokemon Silver is an early Pokemon game released in 1999 for the Game Boy Color. Kanto is a region in the Pokemon world that was introduced in the first Pokemon games, Pokemon Red and Pokemon Green, released in Japan in 1996, and later in the US as Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue.

The reason it was amazing to visit Kanto in Pokemon Silver was that it was the first time in the series that players were able to explore two regions in a single game. The game takes place three years after the events of the original Pokemon Red and Blue, and the player starts in the new Johto region, which has its own set of eight gym leaders to battle and a new set of Pokemon to catch.

After the player completes the Johto region's main story, they unlock the ability to travel to the Kanto region and challenge its eight gym leaders, as well as battle some of the characters from the original games. This was a big deal because it essentially allowed players to experience two games in one, and it was a significant expansion of the game's content compared to its predecessors.

Additionally, players who were fans of the original games were excited to see Kanto again, but with updated graphics and new challenges. It was a nostalgic trip down memory lane for some players and an exciting new adventure for others who were experiencing the region for the first time.",264,0,57900,57900,,57900,xhable,eru777,0

"The fact that you could visit Kanto in pokemon silver was mindblowing back then, still amazing","On my 12th birthday I visited a local games shop to see what Game Boy or PS1 games I could spend some of my birthday money on. Sitting there on the shelves were a handful of copies of Pokemon Gold and Silver. I couldn't believe my eyes, like I knew there were new games coming eventually, but how was it possible I was looking at them without knowing what they were called or when they were being released?

I asked the guy behind the counter if they were real. He told me they were US imports (I'm in the UK) that had only been released there a few days prior - I thought he was exaggerating but I would learn years later they'd literally only come out in the US 3 days earlier - and they wouldn't be officially released over here for another 6 months or so. I debated with myself for a good 10 minutes which one I should buy and eventually went with Silver.

It was the next day before I got a chance to start playing, and I was sucked in immediately. Full colour. An egg as the first McGuffin. Old 'mons and new side by side. I played it all day and found so many new features that blew my mind. What do you mean, my Pokemon laid an egg? Woah, this Zubat is a different colour, I need to catch it! Wait, there are Dark and Steel types now? Hold up, not only is my Golbat a different colour, now it's *evolving*??

A few days later and I'd finally beaten the Elite Four, and when Professor Elm gave me the S.S. Ticket my mind was blown. I'm sailing to Vermillion City? I'm... going back to the first games? And a week or so later I'm fighting Red, with his level 81 Pikachu!? For months I had the doubt in the back of my mind that I'd been scammed and had bought a really well made bootleg, there was so much about it that didn't feel real. So when my friend bought Gold on the official UK release and showed me his progress, I saw just how real it was, and felt so vindicated in putting so much time into it.

Eventually I was able to borrow another friend's GB and link cable, so that I could trade my Gen 1 'mons over and complete the Pokedex. Thanks to trading with that friend (and getting Mew from a Nintendo event) I had all 151 Pokemon in my copy of Yellow, so to get to 250 in Silver was the next step. It took me the better part of a year between trading with both myself and those friends, figuring out some of the new evolution methods, chasing down and finally catching the legendary beasts, but I got there in the end, all while levelling my main team of 6 to 100. I still remember that team so well - Feraligatr, Crobat (shiny), Electrode, Aerodactyl, Ho-oh and Mew. It felt like the biggest accomplishment of my young life. Then we had to Gameshark in a Celebi lol.

My game time was around 430 hours when I finally moved onto new games. I'll never forget that experience and will always be so thankful I went to that little independent game shop on my 12th birthday.",3,0,57900,57900,,57900,TheUndertakeHer,eru777,0

But he’s not a good actor and he hasn’t been in a single “good” movie. But it doesn’t matter and I don’t care.

A generous stranger recently gave me an awesome bundle of Sega Genesis stuff!,"Last week, my family and I hosted one of our [Retro Roadshow](https://www.retroroadshow.org) events for a local elementary school ""Science Night."" We decided to let the kids at the event learn about video game history by setting up variety of consoles (Atari 2600, Mattel Intellivision, NES, SNES, N64 and GameCube), all playing games staring Nintendo's Mario. It was a blast for us, and the hundreds of families who came through loved it!

A couple days later, I was contacted by one of the parents who stopped by - he said that his daughter loved our presentation and asked if we might want ""some old Sega stuff"" to add to our Roadshow museum. Naturally I said yes sight-unseen, and when we finally opened the box, we were blown away by what he gave us:

* A Sega Genesis console
* Multiple 3-button and 6-button Genesis controllers
* A Genesis arcade-stick controller

In addition to the hardware, he also gave us a bunch of awesome games, including:

* Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade
* Streets of Rage 2
* ThunderForce 2
* Shinobi III
* Strider
* Street Fighter II
* GhostBusters (this appears to be the Japanese version)
* Midnight Resistance 
* AirBuster
* Mega Man X and a Game Genie (a surprising SNES inclusion in a Sega bundle!)

We were so touched by this generous gift! He understood that this stuff is worth some money, but all he asked is that we make sure to include this system in a future Retro Roadshow exhibition for kids to learn about, which is exactly what we'll do.

It was smart not to release it on PC, it used the same engine as GTA 4 which had a really shit PC port.

I'm probably in the minority in this because I see achievements thrown at me left and right in every game for doing basically nothing.

> *""Opened the game 5 times! Diligent Opener unlocked! Only 78% of players achieved this!""*

It's a no-effort way to incentive more gameplay, chasing down meaningless and arbitrary achievements to artificially pad the game - rather than, ya know, actual content.

> *""Cynical Comment unlocked! Only 94% of redditors have ever posted a cynical comment! You're special!""*

Medium / Long-Term Future of Gaming Tech - Your Opinion?,">	A LOT has happened in the 40+ years I’ve been on this rock we call “Earth”, including in the world of gaming

I played online multiplayer games with real time player interactions in 1995 already, nearly 30 years ago. 1997 we saw Ultimate Online, then shortly after EverQuest. Even WoW came out almost 20 years ago. Certainly, everything is bigger and better (resolution, colors, frame rates, fidelity, 3D, etc), more simultaneous players are supported, and there are more genres. We’ve also seen the distribution and publishing models change. Mobile gaming became a major market, even though the more traditional gamers tend to overlook or reject it.

But fundamentally, gaming hasn’t really changed all that much, not even the input methods. The only truly new thing is VR, but it’s been there for some time now and hasn’t caught on yet (it’s still niche). I nevertheless believe that bigger changes in gaming may come from that direction, but only if VR/MR technology advances significantly. This will go hand in hand with how media is consumed.

Besides this, I think the distribution model will change again (subscription services) and AI will be much more prominent in both development and gameplay (more dynamic). But those won’t revolutionize gaming, I don’t think. Maybe games are like books. Many aspects of books today are different from a hundred years ago, but much is also still the same.",2,0,1,1,"Let's be honest, when it comes to gaming, we've pushed graphics *almost* as far as they can go *without* moving to photorealistic...

Might switch from Playstion 5 to Xbox Series S,"Your talking about steam money, so I'm guessing you have a PC. All Xbox exclusives are Microsoft exclusives, so they will be available on PC at or near the same time, and upgrading a PC to the power of a series s is not ""that"" expensive.

PS exclusives pretty much stay exclusive for the most part right now, though we are starting to see ""some"" come out on PC.

Neither Series X or PS5 are actually full 4k, they super-sample pretty heavily. 

Thier are some 3rd party comptrollers for PS5 that are closer to Xbox controllers, but they are expensive. (razer wolverine v2 for ps5) 

IMHO the best combo right now is PC and Ps5 you get access to both major parties exclusives on release. And if you want to just game with both at a desk a decent DAC that has alt channels like the SoundBlaster gc7 and a good 1440p monitor now that PS5 has support for that it can be used for both systems effectively.",3,0,0,0,"Im thinking of selling my Playstation 5 and slightly downgrading to an Xbox Series S.

Might switch from Playstion 5 to Xbox Series S,"1. PlayStation. Has the best exclusives considering single player story driven games, but since your only playing sport titles, this might not matter to you.

2. Disc swapping is a pain, and there little difference in preservation due to most game needing  expansive patches to play.  Main points of have disk games now a days, is you can resell it and they tend to go on sale more often with steeper discounts.    Also you can rent games instead of buying them. 

3. You will eventually get used to the controller once you play with it enough. I had the same problem but reverse(Xbox  controllers  felt odd to me for awhile) now can easily swap betmween the 2 now.

4. series S plus gamepass is great. Plus it can play retro games from emulators pretty easily. But personally would keep it as a 2nd console primarily for gamepass and not a PS5 replacement. Also Xbox has a great rewards program.  Just doing want you can on phone/pc without an Xbox can easily get you 10k points a month which can get you a free series S in 2 years",2,0,0,0,"Im thinking of selling my Playstation 5 and slightly downgrading to an Xbox Series S.

You're not going to recover all the money from selling the PS5, so that 300$ to buy the Xbox just jumped to 400$ because you're losing money on the sale. An Xbox series S is not worth $400

I understand they didn’t want to make another trilogy and stretch out the story past it’s means but they built up so many characters, especially on the Norse side, that ended up either not really doing much or just feeling underdeveloped by the end like Thrud and Sif just because they didn’t want to make a trilogy. Feels like the impact of these deaths and occurrences was lessened because they were just speedrunning both the setup of corruption outside of mimir’s stories in the first game AND the downfall that comes from it. Like we meet and we’re supposed to care about Thor’s family but by the end they’re kind of just relegated to a small support system for Atreus and will probably not come back the next game since they finished what they needed to with Norse myths.

I feel like there's definately potential for Loki-based games, but also we have Kratos' next story. He is still a god of war, but now he's more like how they described Tyr: compassionate, merciful, looking for peace. I honestly thought thats where they were going, having Kratos take up a new god of war's mantle. That being said, he has a drive to rebuild in Midgard, and I think he will actually be a god to people instead of to himself. Odin asks if he even knows what its like to be worshipped and loved by mortals, and now he will. I think his story leads him to being a new god who rebuilt the world in the ashes of Ragnerok.
