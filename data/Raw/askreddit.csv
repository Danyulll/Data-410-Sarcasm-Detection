Who is a bad guy in history who actually wasn’t a bad guy?,"Captain Hazelwood of the Exxon Valdez.  

He is often pictured on the helm of the Exxon swaying drunkenly going full throttle into the reef talking like a ""pirate."" 


What actually happened. 

Valdez's critical navigation equipment was out of commission, fax's sent to Exxon and Exxon told them to sail instead.

Coast guard budget cuts removed vessel tracking in the area. 

Green and tired crew was on duty, request was made to relief crew. It was denied. 


XO who was on Conn at the time was inexperienced on the passage and neither requested pilotage. 

While Hazelwood did drink that day he was not in command of the conn at the time and was in his quarters resting. 

Hazelwood made a comment that ""He needed a drink."" Because of how upset he was over the situation. 

Exxon's PR paid off the media to blame Hazelwood. 


However Hazelwood was charged with only one charge which was for pollution. He proved he was not a drunkard and retained his captain's license. Even getting offers to sail again which he turned down. 


The real villains are mass media, Fake News, and comedians but Exxon's PRs spending power to keep the blame off them. 


Hazelwood passed away last year after the annv of the spill.

Who is a bad guy in history who actually wasn’t a bad guy?,"A lot of Tudor women come to mind; Katherine Howard, Mary Tudor and Anne Boleyn. 

Katherine was sexually abused her entire life only for Thomas Culpepper to use it to blackmail and assault her. Almost every man in her life abused or used her and she died a teenage girl. After her death people made up bullshit about her wanting to be married to a rapist and blackmailer. SHE WAS A CHILD. 

Mary Tudor was horrifically abused by her own father, torn from her mother and prevented from seeing her (even as she was dying) and went on to be demonised way more heavily than her father who was a tyrant. Mary tried her best with what she had. After her father divorced her mother she lived with the constant threat of assassination or execution. Her own father was willing to kill her. 

Anne Boleyn was not a seductress who tried to steal the King. She did not want the king and initially flirted with him to get back at a guy who courted and ditched her. She only agreed to marry Henry because she had to. Even before he met Anne he was looking for a way to end his marriage to Catalina (Catherine) De Aragon. Why? Because the only reason they were Marie was to preserve an alliance with Spain and that fell through and she didn’t have a son. None of which was Catalina’s fault. Nor was Anne’s. Anne Boleyn never wore yellow during the time of mourning for Catalina. Anne didn’t abuse Mary. Henry did.",1077,0,24530,24530,,24530,Lordofthepotatoes69,jamespeech111,0

The reality is that the First Persian Empire or the Achaemenid Empire was pretty forward thinking for the era; this is the empire that freed the Jews from the Babylonians and gave the world the Cyrus Cylinder which some regard as the first bill of rights.

As for Sparta? It was a militaristic society based on Social Darwinism (centuries before the birth of Charles Darwin) and it had a greater percentage of slaves than Persia ever did.

- It was also during Hoover’s Presidency that mass media like radio and newsreels started spreading wildly, and Hoover was a breathtakingly awful speaker with poor public relations skills.

He asked Hitler to intercede and ask the Japanese to behave (he really didn't know how little that dude cared about human lives).

When he returned, he discovered what was all about. As a Nazi, all his property was confiscated and he and his family were left to starve. When the Chinese people he had saved heard about it they send parcels with **food** to him and his family.

"People whose homes have dog/cat doors, have wild animals ever entered your pet doors and what happened when that occurred?","So my very sweet and timid kitty had her own cat door and she liked to go out and hang out in the limbs of the big old tree in our back yard. That is, until a big mean yellow tom cat moved in across the street and started stalking her like a thug. He made it his life mission to make her miserable, so she always hung out within darting distance of the safety of her cat door. 

Well, one night in the middle of the night I was rudely awakened by an awful caterwauling coming from inside the house. I leapt out of bed -- and found it was THAT TOM CAT who had followed her INSIDE, going through the cat door, and was now terrorizing her INSIDE HER OWN HOME. Aw HELL no! This was NOT going to happen to my sweet little kitty! 

I started banging and clashing and screaming at him, chasing him round and round the house through room after room, with him in an absolute panic in a terrorized scramble, trying desperately to remember how the hell to escape through the cat door whose location he only vaguely remembered now that he was in the grip of the fear of dying. He darted under the guest bed which was in the room where the cat door was located. Now that I at least had him cornered, I closed the interior door to that room, and opened the door that led outside, and invited him to leave. He would not move. I got a flashlight and a broom to flush him out, but on my hands and knees I found that he had crawled up into the metal wiring on the bottom of the box spring. And there he was stuck. Completely at my mercy. Unable to move more than a whisker. He was shaking in fear. 

I spoke to him calmly, promised I would not wring his neck, and told him I would help him escape. Well, that was easier said than done. I ended up dragging the mattress off the bed, and then flipping the box spring up so I could access the stuck cat better. No amount of pushing or pulling or prodding could dislodge him from his predicament. It was quite a pickle.

In the end, I retrieved the wire cutters from the basement and clipped several of the thick black S-shaped wires that entrapped him, essentially ruining the box spring. But he darted out that open door like the proverbial greased lightning, leaving at least one of his nine lives behind.

He continued to terrorize my poor kitty every chance he got, but he never again came in that cat door. Both me and my cat heaved a sigh of relief when he and his people moved away a year or so later and peace once again reigned in the neighborhood .",300,0,6816,6816,,6816,triviaqueen,99_Restaurant,0

“AHH- Dexter!— Hes… hurry! Get back NOW. Help.”

Dexter was our older dog who had been having infrequent but periodic seizures over the past couple years.  I figured it was happening again and she was freaking out.  I wasn’t far, so I turned around and parked out front.

Shit the door is locked, I had gone out the garage.  Run around to the side door.  Also locked.  Go around to garage, fuck the opener is in my car at the front of the house.  Go around to the OTHER side door, unlocked fortunately.  Finally.  While I know there’s nothing I can really do, I know she is scared and needs me there with her for Dexter.  I know the sense of urgency she would want me to have and am a little out of breath running all around the house trying to get back inside.

**”SOMEONE IS IN THE HOUSE.”**



My adrenaline shoots through the roof.

… what the FUCK?  Why were you withholding this information until just now?!?

I grab the bat I keep by the bed.  “Where are they?”

“Well I didn’t see a person but a dog walked into our room and I assume someone brought them in.”

Wave of relief.

“That doesn’t really make any sense.  Did you hear a person walking around?”

“No Idk just go check it out.”

Second wave of relief.

I check the whole house and no one is there, but I find a poor frightened dog hiding behind the washing machine in the room where our doggie door is.  

It wasn’t a wild animal, definitely someone’s pet at some point.  But this poor animal is half shaved, yes half shaved, and looks like a mess.  What makes it even weirder is that it is NOT possible for a dog to just find itself in that part of our yard.  It’s a small narrow runner with tall fences on all sides and two locked gates.  No sign of burrowing under anything.  Our neighborhood has a gate and is not the kind of place people just wander into to drop dogs off in.  All yards are very visible to a lot of other houses.  So someone got in, then came to our front yard, opened our gate, and dropped their dog into a narrow runner full of dog poop and left without anyone noticing.

There is a happy ending, because we got it groomed and fed and she was incredibly cute, an older lady down the street was overjoyed to get to take care of her and we see her often in the neighborhood now.",1376,0,6816,6816,,6816,ballimir37,99_Restaurant,0

"People whose homes have dog/cat doors, have wild animals ever entered your pet doors and what happened when that occurred?","We lived in a 3rd floor walk-up condo, and put a cat door in the sliding door onto the balcony patio for our 10yo girl cat to come and go (and we moved the litter box out there to great effect, once we were confident she wasn't suffering from the winter cold).

Late one Saturday night she appeared in our bedroom after making a distressed meow from the hall.  The little shape in her mouth told me she'd caught a mouse.

She dropped it on the tile floor and I realized the mouse also has wings (and thus was not really a mouse).

I grabbed a shoebox lid and began sliding the bat over the smooth floor to our front door to escort it out... but when we were about 10 feet away from the door it woke up.  It took off and proceeded to loop fast circles around our vaulted ceiling for the next maybe 5 minutes.

My wife of course lost no time getting out her camera to get some great shots of me in my tighty whities trying to swat it out of the air on one of its loops.

Eventually I was able to gently knock it out of the air with the shoebox, and even as it screeched in protest, I shooed it safely out our front door and shut it.  No sign of it next morning, so I assumed it found its way home safely.",87,0,6816,6816,,6816,Falco98,99_Restaurant,0

"People whose homes have dog/cat doors, have wild animals ever entered your pet doors and what happened when that occurred?","Not really a pet door, but

In my 3rd year university apartment, one of my roommates got a dog, and the landowner was okay with it. In the summer, because we had a nice mesh screen to keep bugs out but let air and people go through, and because the dog (Ben) loved napping near fresh air, we'd just keep the door open as long as someone was home and awake.

Of course, one day, Ben decided he was tired of fresh air, and came to nap with me in my room. My roommate did not realize this, nor did I (since I was fast asleep.) Since there was suddenly no big snoring dog at the door, and the door was yet open (a first), some sneaky critter invited itself in. I woke up that afternoon to two sounds; one being my roommate screaming, and two being a squirrel screeching in reaction to my roommate catching it red-pawed in the kitchen. 
The squirrel made a dash for the window, but unfortunately, it was a screen window, and a tough one. My roommate slammed the window shut, so the squirrel was stuck between a screen and glass. 

You wanna know what squirrels do when they are confused, terrified, and trapped between a tight mesh screen and a wood-and-glass window? They leak. They bounce around searching in vain for an exit, they try to claw their way out, and they fucking leak. Poor guy made a mess of the window. Poor roommate got to clean squirrel shit, piss, and bile. Poor Ben no longer got to nap in front of the open door. And poor me, got to wake up from a nap to the most awful sound a rodent could make.",21,0,6816,6816,,6816,ErenIsNotADevil,99_Restaurant,0

There's a panel that I can slide in to block it at night to stop the raccoons from coming in but I often forget. I don't really care unless they make a big ruckus but raccoons are smart so I think they've realized that making a bunch of noise means they get blocked from the food so they've been fairly behaved lately.

"People whose homes have dog/cat doors, have wild animals ever entered your pet doors and what happened when that occurred?","Not a cat or dog door, but...

I was in our basement one day and thought I heard a mouse, then saw it in my peripheral. No big deal, we don't typically have mice and they don't really bother me. I could set my live trap and be done. My cat Booger Ann was constantly watching under furniture in the basement for the next day.

The next night, my husband was in the basement as it's his man cave. He calls me down to get the mouse. Booger is still on lookout and one of our dogs, Bitsy Beans, is chasing something. Now, Bitsy Beans is a bulldog mix, 12"" tall at the shoulder and 50lbs of oddly shaped flop and muscle. I was getting a kick out her trying to push her smoosh face under furniture.

She finally corners the ""mouse"" at the base of the steps. To my surprise, it's not a mouse! It's a chubby little vole.

I had my husband grab Bitsy so I could corral the vole. The vole scurried into the laundry room, which also has our utilities.

I can't find it, then all of a sudden Booger walks in and lies down in front of a piece of pvc pipe. The vole comes out and they touch noses. Booger made a friend. Booger is weird. Sometimes, she's Booger the Brave. Others, she's Booger the Brat. This day, she was Booger the Benevolent.

So I grabbed some cat food from the cat dish behind me and this vole comes out of the pipe, up to my fingers, and grabs his cat food snack and just eats it right there in front of me. 

I scooped her up into a cat treat container with my hand, then took a few pics and released her in the yard. I named her Happy FuzzButt because she was so cute.

There was a wooded area behind the house and the cat door opened up to the backyard from a hallway adjacent to the kitchen. So one night I’m making a sandwich and I hear the cat door. Which wouldn’t be unusual except I don’t have a cat. I poke my head around the corner to see what wayward kitty had wandered in annndddd it’s a skunk. He looked just as surprised to see me as I was to see him. And we just… kind of stare at each other. I happened to be holding a slice of cheese and I have no idea why I did this but I squatted down really slowly then held it out to him. ??? He looks at me like he’s weighing the options of whether it’s a trick or not then very slowly walks towards me, slowly takes the slice of cheese, and walks *backwards* just as slowly right back out the cat door. As soon as he was completely through the door I laughed so hard I wheezed. 

My husband came to see what was so funny and I was still squatting there, laughing hysterically like I’d finally lost all of my marbles. I managed to honk out “skunk” and “cheese.” He looked at me wide eyed and nervously started backing away, just like the skunk had and I don’t know why but this was *also* hilarious to me for some reason.

Eventually the racoon found the container of food and started getting aggressive. I cornered it and tried to scare it away but it beefed up and came at me. Eventually I scared it back out and I had to get a live trap, got him first try. Drove it 20 miles out but was still nervous the next season because they can apparently find their way back from like 50 miles sometimes.",7,0,6816,6816,,6816,chi11p4ck,99_Restaurant,0

"People whose homes have dog/cat doors, have wild animals ever entered your pet doors and what happened when that occurred?","I had 2 labradors so we had to have somewhat of a big doggy door. The dogs like it but its quite big for the cats. Its also a bit heavy so the wind doesn’t blow it open.
However my cats are deffinitly hunters when they get outside and often bring in mice, small rats and some small birds through that door.
But that was in the beginning. After a while the prey got bigger and just a few days ago in the late evening they brought in yet another duck! 
And that one was still very much alive and seriously kicking! That duck was on a wild rampage as it tried to free itself from my cat that was trying to drag it upstairs to eat it. Loud screams and blood and feathers everywhere. It was mayhem. Luckily my brother was upstairs and startled the cat which made it release the duck. But now we had a duck on the run in the house and the cat trying to grab it again. The duck crashed against all the walls and windows. My mom meanwhile had opened the outside door hoping the duck would find the exit.

It was midnight, I was tired, and I had just walked into my room to get ready for bed. It wasn’t a school night, but there was something in my backpack that I wanted to grab so I bent down to get it. SOMETHING HISSED AT ME. I screamed. It wasn’t my cat. A baby opossum was behind my backpack, in my room, having gotten all the way through the house and snuck by the cat. My parents got a paper bag and a broom to try and get it out and I just remember standing in the hallway to keep my cat from going in my room when I heard “ITS CLIMBING UP THE BROOM!” The little bugger was hissing the whole time.

One of our cats is a killing machine. We found her at a bus stop when she was little, and she wasn't too rough yet but she'd already begun adapting to the streets, and in my experience, they never forget that.     

Anyway, a couple of times she's brought stuff inside to play with, and it's not quite dead. One time she came running in the house with something in her mouth making a loud, shrill, sort of warbling sound. I thought it was a cicada or maybe some little bird. Anyway I ran into the kitchen (where the sliding door is) and saw her standing there, wild-eyed, with this tiny screaming thing in her mouth, and I immediately shouted ""NO Luna! Out! Outside!"" And pointed at the open door. She jumped, frightened by my loud noises, and DROPPED A VERY MUCH ALIVE MOUSE on the floor, which immediately made a beeline to disappear into the gap under the fridge.     

Anyway, I was hella mad at first, but we never saw that mouse again and have never found evidence of any pests inside our house, so I assume it either found a way to escape back outside or she came back in the night to finish it off.

"People whose homes have dog/cat doors, have wild animals ever entered your pet doors and what happened when that occurred?","I knew a guy who was having a barbecue with friends at his place in the mountains. The barbecue was around the side of the house and they had left the back door open while they went in and out bringing food out. His female roommate came home from work and got in the shower. A little while later, mosquitoes were coming out and he went around and closed the back door. The latch on the door was a bit faulty and it would lock on it’s own. Just as he closed it, it locked itself but he figured that his roommate would be out soon and she could open it from the inside, so it wasn’t a problem. 

Except….. he had locked a massive black bear into the house with her! She was still in the shower and there was no way to open the door. Everyone at the barbecue was watching the bear through the window and waiting for her to come out of the shower. When she did, they were all frantically waving at the windows and she was waving back saying she’d be out in a sec! Eventually she saw the bear but she couldn’t get to the outside door, so she had to hide while the landlord and the RCMP (Canadian small town police) were called to get it out of the house!",3,0,6816,6816,,6816,Damn_Canadian,99_Restaurant,0

When did you find out that someone in your family is evil?,"I had an aunt, my mother's sister, Betty. She was mean as a snake. Not in physical way, but in a domineering, my-way-or-the-highway kind of manner.

For some reason she never liked me. I'm sure it was something stupid I said when I was six or seven. But it really was so obvious that even my immediate family would wonder what I had ever done to her. Then again, she loved to take swipes at everyone and everybody if they weren't living life or saying things in precise accordance with the way Betty thought it should be. Essentially the self-appointed dowager of the family, determined to dictate to everyone how they should live their lives. 

Betty was married to her poor husband. And no occasion with those two ever was complete without her giving him a tongue lashing for something trivial. When Bill died, there was no funeral, no nothing. Just took his ashes and dumped them in the sea.

Anyway, Betty used to go on vacations by herself all over the world. We just took it for granted that her husband didn't want to go. Until, that is, her husband died.

As it turns out, Betty had something like a thirty-year affair with someone, a guy who was always her traveling companion. When my uncle died, this guy was over the moon because now Betty was newly single. Only he didn't realize that Betty had a different guy waiting in the wings.

I won't go into all the things she did and said, but she had two kids. Her son was molested by a next door neighbor when he was a kid. Betty knew about it and did nothing. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. But she sure liked to talk shit about her son. He's messed up to this day. And she continued with her son's children. Just would talk about what idiots they were. One grandson got so tired of it, he literally married an Australian girl, moved there, and has never been back. 

Meanwhile, at my other cousin's 65th birthday party, Betty thought it would be nice to tell an adorable anecdote about how my cousin was a nice little rule follower. She proceeds to tell the story about how she absolutely forbade my cousin, when walking home from school, from crossing the street if there was no crossing guard.

One day, the crossing guard did not show up for work. So my cousin stood petrified at the curb for two solid hours until my aunt realized her daughter had not come home from school. While Betty thought she was telling a story about her daughter, in truth she was telling a story about herself.

So, yeah. No bank robberies. No torturing kittens or anything like that. Instead, a steady, relentless savaging of anyone near and dear to her in life. Not a reflective bone in her body either.

EDIT: the disorder is called INAD - Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy


About 5 years ago when I discovered that my cousin lied about having a severely disabled daughter who she said was going to die a terrible death and not make it much past 8. 


Story:

My cousin had a baby and then disappeared for a few years. When the baby was 3 she came back into our lines with the worst news I have ever heard. Her daughter had a disease that was going make her deteriorate quickly. She would lose her sight, hearing and mobility before eventually dying. 

She had a huge fundraiser event in her new community she moved to. She falsified doctor letters and records so she could take advantage of charities like the make a wish foundation. The make a wish foundation sent her family to Disney World. 


The truth came out when people in her community realized the money she raised from the fundraiser didn’t actually go to the cause. She had pictures on social media of them going to the bank and everything. After it came out she was the scum id the earth, she vanished and no one has heard from her since.

When did you find out that someone in your family is evil?,"My mom is a compulsive liar and sociopath who made a career of weaving webs of deception. Every job and every relationship started with her being a rockstar, but after a few years she would always be figured out and fired or left by a husband/boyfriend. Her current relationship is a nightmare. She found some farmer with a father who can’t fend for himself and a brother who killed himself. She pounced on his weakness and married him while getting him addicted to drugs and serving a man who has had heart attacks giant steaks, ice cream,  and honey buns every night. She wants to outlive him, take his farm that has been in the family for generations, and give it to my sister and I as some sort of sick parting gift. We don’t want it and have already repeatedly told her we’d give it back to the family. Jokes on her though, she has gotten herself addicted to methamphetamine and now lives in a paranoid delusion that everyone is out to get her. I feel bad for the husband though, because he has to take care of her now that she spends all night “digging up dinosaurs” and rearranging the kitchen for the 13th time this month. Her body and mind are starting to fail her. I took her to an emergency room and had the hospital staff run a drug screening that confirmed the meth. She has and always will deny anything is ever wrong or that she ever needs help. She has refused all attempts my sister and I have made to reach out and offer help. My grandmother attempted suicide recently. We went to check on her and found a note. I’ll never forget going from closet to closet checking for her body. In the note, she begged for someone to step in and help my mom (they have a sort of sick codependent relationship). At this point, nobody dares go up to the farm and see what kind of state they are in. We are considering having the state step in and take control of her, but there are so many drugs up there that they’d probably both end up going to prison… not to mention it’s really hard to make that kind of call on someone you grew up idolizing and being really close to. It was hard growing up and slowly realizing over time that everything was a lie and she never really gave a shit about any of us, we were just props on display. She’d put me in a suit and tie when I was 12 and show me off to her bosses saying that I was Oxford bound and going to change the world when in reality I had crippling anxiety and learning disorders, and an eating disorder that made school a living hell. My hell away from hell. All that being said, I still love her, but I’d be lying if I said all this hasn’t really fucked up my ability to trust or be close with people. I have acquaintances, not friends. Every relationship I’ve ever been in until recently, regardless of how supportive, has ended with me being cold and distant. I am in a great relationship now though and overall of a much more stable mind and body. We plan to move across the country later this year and leave all of this baggage behind.

My older sister is a sociopath. She’s 7 years older than me and she was horrible my whole life but there’s one incident that really sticks out. My family was dysfunctional on many levels and holidays weren’t usually a thing bc my parents never seemed to like us kids having any joy. Anyways when I was 14 they decided this year we would celebrate thanksgiving which we’d never done previously. I was opening the cranberry sauce when she lost it bc it wasn’t the ‘right’ one. She jump on me knocking me to the ground and tried to gouge my eyes out telling me I ‘didn’t deserve to see anymore’ yeah…when I was 18 I cut contact with all of them.

Second one…unfortunately I ended up in an abusive relationship when I was an adult bc that behavior was so normalized. I had three kids with him and he was horrible both mentally and physically to me. Once he told me if he was “going to rape and kill anyone it’s be me and he’d know where to hide the body.” He also would say he wanted to know what it felt like to kill someone and would tell me how if he did he’d draw it out for as long and as painful as possible. I wanted to leave but I had no friends and from the example above clearly no family. I’d call women’s shelters but there was never any spots for me and my kids. One day I found out he had been telling everyone I was mentally unwell and that I was suicidal (I wasn’t) and that he was worried one day he’d come home he’d find me with “blood everywhere.” I believe he was setting it up to kill me and get away with it. Plus his dad was a police sergeant and they both told me he’d never get in trouble for anything he did. I didn’t want to die so I got a permanent restraining order. I was homeless, jobless, and carless. 5 years have passed and I now have a home, car, and I’m about to graduate with my masters :)",4,0,629,629,,629,Paleyam75,onlyusemefeets,0

When did you find out that someone in your family is evil?,"Found out? When my aunt and uncle wrote a letter about how my grandma was a terrible mother…because she didn’t name my uncle as the executor of her estate (she’d named my other uncle, just because he’d been more involved in her finances).

Like, just about everyone else knew. My aunt had been jealous of my mom for being close to my uncle from “go.” She cut off her mom over an antique rocking chair. She sucked up to dying relatives to get their money. She got rid of my grandma’s cat. 

I had an inkling when I was maybe twelve or thirteen. I was nervous about going on a rope swing over a creek—I was clumsy and anxious—and that was the first time I ever saw anyone look at someone with contempt.

She reinforced it when my grandma was dying. I was the one to text my uncle that, no, this is happening, and it was going to be his absolute last chance to ever see her. She berated me until I cried—I’d been at my grandma’s bedside for two days, so it wasn’t difficult—and then kept going. It wasn’t until my uncle very meekly told her to stop that she did…whilst glaring daggers at him. Pretty sure she’s abused and controlled him for decades.

My cousin on that side is a kind, smart, gentle person. I’m so glad she was able to marry into a large, supportive family and get away. She doesn’t really talk to her parents. My mom gets invited to her kids’ birthday parties, and her own parents don’t. I’m just mostly glad she’s away and happy.

My aunt never really worked and my uncle retired at forty-smth (because of health and political issues, no shade) and since then they’ve been trying to get every social bonus money they somehow could. They have a foster child and lied about her being more disabled and in need of care than she is and got the responsible office to give her the highest degree of care help which is I think 2000+€ per month. The foster child also didn’t go to school after eight grade and smoked at twelve and does drugs and my aunt and uncle just dont really care. They get retirent money and also for some reason unemployement money and their rent and utilities paid by the government because ???? They have more money than my parents who both work full time. AND THEN they often ask my grandmother (my mothers and aunts mum) for money. They once *invited* her out for lunch at a restaurant my grandmother likes, and then had HER pay for all the food. They didn’t even pack their money because they knew my grandmother is too nice (and slightly demented) to not pay. The foster child also had a baby last year (she’s 18, father is 14!!) and the baby is already overweight (like the whole bunch) and has been to the hospital twice because they don’t care for it properly. Also they had a dog until recently and it was clear that the dog was very sick, she had an eye infection and propably cancer. The dog was such a nice animal but they didn’t treat her right. She only got out of the house twice a day for a few minutes, was screamed at and kicked whenever she moved her paw wrong and got fed the rests of the human food, which made her have diarrhoea every day and then she got yelled at again for pooping inside because they didn’t feed her right. My mother was telling her sister for years that she would love to take the dog if they didn’t want her (because they obviously didn’t want her) but my aunt always said no. Then last year they one day just took her to the vet and had her put down. Like no warning or real reason, her sickness didn’t get worse, my grandmother had seen the dog that morning and then in the afternoon asked where she was and my uncle just said she was euthanised. Propably for the best for her so she doesn’t have to endure that treatment anymore but I mean wtf.",2,0,629,629,,629,gumbeebald,onlyusemefeets,0

Everyone that knew him talked about what a good, Christian man he was, someone who talked the talk and walked the walk.

My grandmother and her siblings couldn't believe such a thing, not her precious little brother.

When did you find out that someone in your family is evil?,"It was kind of a slow burn. 

First, it started off with my mother bullying another girl in my class on my Facebook. We were like 9. 

Second, around this same time, we were watching an episode of Ugly Betty. One of the characters is East Asian and he had mixed kids with a white woman and my mother said it would be terrible to have kids with “one of them” because of the way East Asian’s look. I just remember looking at her and I was confused because he and his kids looked perfectly fine to me. 

Third, she claimed that Obama shouldn’t be president just because of his skin colour. 

Fourth, she told me to kill myself and drown my future children when I was 16 because I was smoking weed at the time. I was living with my dad at this time, thankfully. She said a lot of terrible things to me at this time, I don’t remember most of it anymore but I do still remember how it felt hearing all of that come from my own mother. 

Fifth, she kept asking me weird and invasive questions about my dad and his dating life. 

I tried to give my mother chance after chance, mostly cause a lot of the adults in my life kept saying I’d hate myself in the future if I didn’t forgive her and my own grandmother told me to forgive her despite all of the racist and abusive things she’s said. She’s also stalked and harassed my brother and his girlfriend, she used to beat my dad up, she used to hit me too when I was a kid, and did the same to my brother after they moved to the UK.

When this happend, I was still a kid. He was my hero, a super funny man with great jokes and long hair and long beard. Maybe he is evil (I know he has mental issues) but he also defended my mother (his sister) when her boyfriend was abusive. If he would’ve known that guy SA me multiple times when I was around 9-11, I know he would have killed him. And that’s like the bad part of it.

So, while my grandfather was really confused with cancer, to ""punish"" him, my evil aunt and uncle had him sign over those tickets that are worth roughly $32,000 and big money generators over to them.

 Not sure how that punishes my grandfather other than to make him sad he did that to me after he promised them to me. My mother and I were the only people to ever bother with my grandfather. The kicker? Those two fuckers knew they were STILL inheriting 28% of the will some like $900,000 and I was only getting the tickets. My uncle worked in gov and has a 6figure pension on top of that $900,000. I live on disability. How greedy do you have to be? I will NEVER forgive them for doing me so dirty.

When did you find out that someone in your family is evil?,"Oh boy this is gonna be good, so you need some popcorn for this. When my father started choking my mom in front of me at the end of last year's summer. This went on for months where he also hit her until my mom made the wise decision to leave his sorry ass. As the months went, I grew hatred towards him even more. He always judged me, told me I am a nobody, degraded me and was always mad at me and constantly screaming at me. Because my grades weren't the best, but they were good. He went a PTA meeting once and I asked my form teacher to not invite him and don't tell him about a meeting. Either my mom comes or no one and I wouldn't care, because she never screamed at me for absolute no reason, she always understood my feelings and didn't treat me like I am a fucking accident and a trophy to brag about, but her own blood who she loves, nurtures, helps, supports and comforts when I am at the lowest, in short, she is acting like a good mother and I have no clue how to thank her. Well, I was last year the second worst student by my average score, but in my defence, my class is full of good students with good grades, some even better, so I wasn't failing at anything or bad at meeting the standards for a good grade. He screamed at me for that and I started acting out. He wanted to throw hands on my mom? How about I grab you and won't let you go until my mom reassures me she is cool? After that he never apologized for laying a hand on a woman or  using me as a stress ball to scream at. So, one night he happened to lay hands on my mom where she called for help, because I was gaming, but I didn't put on my headphones so I can be sure to help when needed because I had to get off my mind from my traumas. I had enough. I went in, let my dad go off my mom and hit him out of defence. I ensured that he won't touch my mom and I spoke to him for the first time after a couple of months of silent treatment and boiling frustration. We moved away from home, crashing at my aunt's place until we get an apartment to live in and start to work to help my mom out in any way I can. Now my parents are getting a divorce, because my dad wants to remove any financial opportunity for my mom so she will have it worse. Oh, funny thing: He called me a few weeks back that it is wrong for me to party and go on dates and spend money, since I am spending so carelessly and not value money. He says it like he was the one who always gave me money when needed. He never gave me even a single dime. He then rang up my mom and she told him that he shouldn't try and discipline and raise me, since I am an adult. He lashed out on me because he needs to pay my mom child support at around 132 Euros (not my country's currency). I never knew until this shit storm happened that he was a violent alcoholic with a huge ego. He wronged me in any way possible. I tried to reconcile due to my mom's pressure after moving out. It wasn't her fault, all she wanted is to despite their differences, I have a nice connection with my dad. I had my gut feeling that this is a very bad idea, but I did it in order my mother would feel better. He never changed, he tried to be nicer to me when I said something he wants to hear. I cut ties with him permanently after my mom told me that she is fully done with him having the file for divorce being the final nail in the coffin for her. I can't help but hate my father more than I could ever imagine having hatred for anyone.

When did you find out that someone in your family is evil?,"2 years ago. Basically my mom moved us out of her childhood home and my uncle moved in so the house would stay in the family. A few years later he moved out of state and the house wasn’t able to stay in the family for some reason. Turns out the reason was he had a (not so) secret child when he was in college and didn’t pay his child support so the bank took the house as payment. This was the house my grandfather passed away in, the house my grandma raised her family in, my childhood house. Now he lives in my grandma’s basement(small second living space) is verbally, mentally, emotionally abusive to my grandma and also being financially abusive to his wife. It’s to the point where it’s normal for his daughter to have more say so than his wife. All of the kids looked up to him and now he’s just a angry man with a short man complex.",1,0,629,629,,629,mali-girl,onlyusemefeets,0
When did you find out that someone in your family is evil?,"There is a high prevalence of psychopathy in our family (very large extended family, perhaps not that unusual as many other mental disorders prevalent too)… but there are quite a few of them.. now, while admittedly I don’t believe imo that it is their fault they’re psychopaths, or even that their lack of empathy inherently makes one ‘evil’….. but erm….. some of them absolutely are on the evil spectrum. 
I think harming animals, children, taking a life for one’s personal gain (ie pleasure), does come under the umbrella of evil.. and all that and more has gone one, many many family members.

And that's how romance works. ^^

Back to sad stories, two out of four daughters are not talking to our mother, and the third one only keeps contact because of her own kids. She knew the babysitter was molesting us but claimed we were making the stories up for attention. She once locked me up in the goat shed. She physically and emotionally abused us for years, occasionally touching us in inappropriate ways for good measure. She told everyone she had several heart attacks, only one functioning kidney, and breast cancer. She told our youngest sister that our father was not her biological father to drive a wedge between them (definitely not true, you just have to look at their respective childhood photos). She refused to seek therapy for her constant lying. After my parents separated, she married a guy who would spoil her with gifts, and travelled with him until he became too sick - then she left him to move to Tunisia for the ""love of her life"" (who is about my age, I've been told). By that time I had cut contact with her because it is not healthy to have someone in your life who wants to make you cut up your feet and get mind-numbingly drunk after every visit. I've told her we can talk if she ever gets her shit together, and have since compared notes with my sisters - about 80 percent of what she ever told me about her life is definitely a lie, the timelines don't add up. I think she is a very troubled woman, but she can be troubled far away from me, thank you very much.",1,0,629,629,,629,LaCaffeinata,onlyusemefeets,0

• Left me by myself in my bedroom for days on end, only to leave a plate of uncooked food (bread and tomato paste, or uncooked hotdogs and ketchup) for me to eat. Hell it was her mother who'd feed me babyfood before I could I feed myself.
• Cheated on my father with her boss from Sears (thank God my grandparents played a substantial role in all parts of our family back then, cause it was first my grandmother who found it all out).
• Abused my sister, and used her as free labor to watch over the crotch spawns she birthed after my father divorced her.
• And lastly, knowingly let the piece of shit, scumbag, good for nothing waste of human fucking life that she remarried molest and rape my sister.

When did you find out that someone in your family is evil?,"My sister is a terrible human being

Where to begin, my sister hates my family with every fiber with her being. She has been spoiled her whole life and been taken care of. My Father worked his ass of to provide for us and raise us. My mother is and has been addicted to work and is not home when she is home. My sister has never had to do any work and, but will say to my face any day that she does more than me. My dad put us through an online academy for high school, my sister dragged it out over 5 years when I showed her that it could be done in 1 year (and it was not even that hard). But she always knows more and decided that it was not worth it and decided to play video games all day and night instead of her schoolwork. My dad begged and pleaded with her to do it, but she just kept blowing him off because a 16 year old knows more about education than a man with a Phd. After I did all the work for her she pulled the exact same stunt in college. 2 years later she drops or fails every class she was ever enrolled in and cannot ever recover her GPA. She refuses to get a job and continues to play games day and night, while disrespecting her family whenever she can. She is the most disrespectful, lazy, disgusting, ignorant, vengeful, and hate-filled human being I have ever known (I know murders, rapists and child molesters who are better that her). I am a paramedic by trade, I have been in houses with decomposing bodies that smell better than her room, which she refuses to clean. My dad wants her to come with us to church, she hates religion despite not giving a reason, I would be able to respect someone who at least had a reason. Anytime she does come with us, she makes sure to be as disrespectful as possible. I physically cannot be around her anymore, because I know she is gonna pull some shit just to piss me off. Anytime that my parents get onto her she is starts using her crocodile tears and says she will change, but it lasts for a day before she is back to her old ways. She “tried to kill her self”, in reality she used a safety razor and barely managed to draw blood. By the time she went to me to take her to the hospital, it was dried up. She tried to make it seem like she was abused to the doctor, but the doctor called her bluff. She stayed in a psych facility for a week, lying the whole time that we abused her. 1 week later and she is back to her old ways, with a 4,000 dollar bill that we had to pay. Now she has herpes and Hepatitis A from God only knows where, and acts like nothing happened. When I see people with their siblings it’s strange, they support each other, but I never had that, I live with a monster who only takes. The only way she sees people is as objects to be used and thrown away. The rate she is going, she is going to end up in a body bag or a prison cell. 

Not trying to discount real attempted suicide Stories, I know my sister and it was 100% fake. As a Paramedic, I have taking care of many people who were not faking, If you feel like killing yourself please seek professional help. Hospital ERs only make sure that you are not a threat to yourself or others, and they do it in a dehumanizing way.

Him and his mother have made my life hell all because his neighbor and I started dating. What happened was he had a crush on a friend of ours (our neighbor) and told me about it, I told him that I also had a crush on said neighbor and he told me it wasn’t right for me to have feelings for her also, (keep in mind at this point he had already asked her out 6 times and she declined and he had also told her he loved her and she rejected him) I told him she wasn’t an object and that she could like whoever she wanted and that I wasn’t wrong for having feelings for her. He started to try and compete with me for her attention and his mom would help him, by locking the door and taking the key when he would go out, or by lying about me when I wasn’t around and trying to ban me from seeing her without him being around. Anyway me and said girl started dating and I left for my grandparents house and now they go around town lying saying she cheated on him with me and calling me judas, also his mom saw me and my girlfriend at a store one day and started cussing us out at the top of her lungs and making a fuss.

My aunt died and i was in charge of everything... she had Cirrhosis, and had few friends left at the end.

Anyway her brother, I'm not going to say uncle, calls me and asks a few questions ( Now mind you he owed her a few grand) about her estate. Specifically her TV's. She had one in every room.

Different sizes, but 7 total. He wanted to swing by and pick one out, 'its what she would have wanted afterall'.

She hated him as he had taken advantage of the family many times over the years..

So I simply told him, that the only people getting anything from her estate, are the people listed in the will as heirs. And that he was not one of them. I did thank him for coming and paying his respects.

Beat our mother when she was pregnant with my brother because he wasn't a she (all he wanted was a daughter).

Creeped on my now wife (we were 15 at the time).

While our mother was in the hospital having surgery that had about a 20% chance of killing her, he told me, his chronically ill, oldest son who wasn't expected to live to adulthood, that he'd rather I been on the table instead.

And I found out a month and a half ago, that I'm not actually his oldest. I have a half brother out there somewhere. And the kicker? The girl he got pregnant was dating his brother, my uncle. He abandoned that kid to foster care once his mom couldn't raise him on her own because, again, he wanted a daughter.

Needless to say, I have no contact with him. And unfortunately that means I need to be no contact with all of his side of the family as well. Cause if I send anyone pictures of my daughter, they will immediately send them to him.

When did you find out that someone in your family is evil?,"So, one of my relatives got a really cute and authentic looking doll. It's a doll that has some basic voice functionality. It's like when we pull its string, it says - ""Hi, I'm Chucky, and I wanna be your friend."". 

One day I was at that relative, and when the doll was just sitting next to me on a sofa next to me. I don't remember putting the doll there. When I pulled its string to play with it a little, trust me on this, the doll said - ""Hi, I'm Chucky, and do you want to play?""

My relative also heard this, so we looked over the doll's manual, and we couldn't find this particular sentence in the voice commands that the doll is supposed to have. So, we again pulled the string, and this time the doll said something that makes us really worried. That's also not supposed to be in the doll's script at all. 

We think that the doll is evil!

When did you find out that someone in your family is evil?,"My Mom was very abusive growing up.  We didn’t realize how we grew up wasn’t normal until many years later.  Then we found out she was now doing similiar things to our father who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s.  Up until then he had literally been waiting on her hand and foot.  She wouldn’t get up from the chair (she was complelty physically fine) all day and bark at him to do or fetch things.  Well as he prgressed, he couldn’t do that anymore since he was losing the ability to match verbal words with things.  She was pissed and complaining all day everyday about how he was making this all up so he wouldn’t have to do anything.  (Man was the freaking hardest worker I ever saw in my life.  It was killing him that this was happening.)  I should also point out he was not that bad yet.  He could still dress himself and do things, but needed a lot of prompting. 

But for example he could no longer work the microwave and she started buying all microwave meals.  For years she had her set meals (to hell with what he wanted.)  Taco Bell Monday.  Pizza Hut Tuesday.  Denny’s Wednesday, etc.  so this was the first red flag.  She claimed she just started really liking them.  Then one night I popped in  and she was eating one and he had nothing in front of him.  She claimed he had already eaten and cleaned up.  

My sister and I through some detective work and talking to her about stuff and getting a few insights found out she was activly trying to kill my father.  It’s a very long story and trust me it was more than conjecture.  She was hiding his meds and food in hopes he would die and she wouldn’t have to deal with him anymore.  He wasn’t even nursing home eligible yet.  But he trusted her.  He was 6’1” and weighed 125 pounds from 190 just six months prior.  She didn’t want any of thier money to go toward a nursing home which was a big part of it.  

My sister and I made an appointment with a lawyer to get guardianship.  Suddenly, my Mom took ill and wnet into the hospital.  Turns out she did have cancer but had a good prognosis and would have had sometime left and fairly good time to boot.  (It was localized and treatable.)   but then she needed a routine treatment so simple it’s ridiculous which she refused because it was “icky”.  She never left the hospital.  The secondary killed her because she was too stubborn to get an enema and constipation which had NOTHING to do with the cancer at all killed her.  No one could force her to and she kept refusing because again, it was “icky”.  (She had had colonscopy and other medical procedures done so it wasn’t anything like that.)

The damage was done.  We got my Dad’s weight back yo.  But the denial of his meds took a huge toll.  He had been progressing REALLY slowly.  I mean really slowly.  We were given a 15 year range from multiple doctors.  But without those meds for that period of time (and I warned her myslelf that you can’t go off once you go on that the progression of the disease speeds up if you go off even more so than if you had never been on.  This had been go over many times because it was a well known side effect but the medicine did work to slow down the disease.)

When I was 16 he got with some girl (who was also a cunt) and I'd babysit her/their kids for some money in the summer. They totally scammed me and ""fired"" me for no reason. 

A year or two later (2017), my grandmother got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer...it was hard on me. He never helped take care of her while I missed school and my mom stopped working to make sure she was comfortable. The only time he showed up was to grab shit as we were cleaning her house out.

 On Thanksgiving (her last family holiday) he showed up to hospice causing a huge stir about not getting everything he wanted from my grandmother... during our last holiday celebration as a family with her. Called my mom every word under the sun with me sitting right next to her. It wasn't till then I truely realized how much of a fucking asshole he was. 

Im not a confrontational person, I don't start fights and try to stay on everyone's good side...that was the closest I was to killing someone. Him causing this scene with my mom (a hard working, honest, loving woman) and ruining my poor grandparents last holiday together, I wanted to beat the ever living shit out of him for that after seeing his true colors. 

I didn't talked to him at the funeral as he sobbed like a baby for attention, few years later (2020) my grandfather died and still I gave him the death stare.

When did you find out that someone in your family is evil?,"My grandmas brother. There were signs when I was a kid like when I found a gun in his nightstand and thought it was a toy. This was in a country in Europe where guns are not commonplace. Thankfully it was not loaded and my great grandmother completely lost her shit at him. Anyway a couple years later he disappeared completely. I later found out he had gone to prison for murder and robbery and god knows what else. When I got older I found out he had been a very corrupt cop and there are some news article comments online to this day that also suggest some further unsavoury crimes. 

Now I understand why after some time he wasn’t allowed around any of the kids (none of his crimes were child related, just a bad person) in the family and eventually no one at all. Looking back, I still remember his face and he wasn’t right… something was so dark about him and I remember instinctively never being comfortable around him even though he was completely fine to me and nice. He’s dead now and I’m glad his son won’t have to deal with the realities of who his father was on a daily basis. In fact I hope he never fully finds out. Not everything is thankfully on the internet from then.",1,0,629,629,,629,peachpie_888,onlyusemefeets,0

But when an extremely wealthy relative passed away when I was around 15, I saw first hand how much greed can turn someone into a completely different person. It was sad to watch. I remember my dad warning me too and it was still a shock. 

But, my relative got the last laugh. When the will was read, he gave away 90% to charity. Some family members still got a nice chunk, but nothing close to what they were all expecting, and others who were expecting something, got nothing.",1,0,629,629,,629,elmatador12,onlyusemefeets,0
When did you find out that someone in your family is evil?,"When my father died, I hadn't had contact with him for 16 years. My sister and I lived in CT, our dad in FL. Our uncle lived the next town over from him, so he offered to start the cremation process while we prepared to go down there and deal with his estate (no will). Well, uncle thought he was entitled to part of his estate, so as blackmail he took a bunch of my father's things, including all the bank records he could find. We still managed to find all his accounts (no diagnosis, but we strongly suspect he had schizophrenia), and while uncle was badgering us to ""reimburse"" him for the cost of the cremation, we discovered that he'd used our dead father's credit card to pay for it. We didn't know any better, it made sense, to have the estate pay for it. Apparently it's illegal, so the funeral home refused to deal with us when we pointed out what they did. So my uncle got the ashes, and then demanded 1/3 of the estate to get them. My sister and I discussed it, our father was a ridiculous penny pincher who prided money over emotions, so we decided that in his honor, we'd tell uncle thanks but no thanks. It caused a small rumble in that side of the family, but we were less than acquaintances with them, so we didn't care. Hope those ashes make you feel good about yourself, Uncle John.


Also, after my father passed, it came to light part of our childhood was a lie. After our parents divorced, we were told things like ""Daddy's taking you this weekend"", so we'd get ready and put our coats on and wait by the door. But our mother had told him we were going to visit family so he couldn't have us. We'd wait and wait and wait, eventually falling asleep, and waking up at 1-2am, confused as to why we were on the couch with our jackets on, and then remember that Daddy forgot about us AGAIN (she did this multiple times). In her words - ""you guys would be all groggy and confused, and then it would hit you and you guys would sob and sob and sob. It was hilarious 😂!"" Now, she had done she seriously awful things, but this - I was 31 at the time with kids of my own - this is when I saw her as evil. She completely ruined any chance I had at having a father, just because she was angry he left her for another woman. She abused us emotionally and psychologically FOR FUN.

Before he moved in, we had a dalmatian that had some aggression issues towards some people but for whatever reason, never me. When my father moved in, he and my dog did not like each other. Every night my dad would pound back beers, smoke pcp or do cocaine. One particular night, he wasn't in the living room like normally. I went to bed and in the morning he woke me up before I had to go to school to tell me my dog died. I was upset all day but my dad was the kind of person that you weren't allowed to cry.

When did you find out that someone in your family is evil?,"I recently realized that my grandmother is a narcissist. Idk how I missed it for all these years (I am a mental health counselor). But none of my grandma’s three children talk to her. Most of her grandchildren don’t speak to her besides me and my siblings. My mom was the last person to cut her off about two years ago. She’s incredibly controlling and demanding. Nothing is ever right for her. She pits me and my siblings against each other. She manipulates situations with money. She will complain about everything. Once I invited her to my bday out to dinner and she complained the entire time about the food. The owner was at our table for the entire night. It was awful. And embarrassing. My mom said “this is why I don’t invite her anywhere.” She’s in her early 90s and will probably die soon. Over last summer was my last ditch effort to mend the relationship between my mom and my grandma. This is when I figured out she’s a narcissist. The way she spoke to my almost 70 year old mother sitting at her kitchen table. My mom shrank into her seat like a child. She said the most awful things to my mom, basically insulting her entire life and all her life choices. Things you’d never imagine saying to your own child. My mom left the house and my grandma had the audacity to ask me if she was in the wrong. I couldn’t take it. Our relationship is not the same anymore. I saw her true self that day and I can’t forget it. It makes everything in my mom’s life make sense. She was traumatized by this woman. Generational trauma is a real thing.

My great grandma had two daughters; one got married gave birth to my dad and the other married Uncle Tony when she was much older but they never had any children. I don’t know why he expected to get anything (especially since his wife died before my great grandma did) but it really made him angry.

When did you find out that someone in your family is evil?,"I have a cousin, that lived with his mom at the time
 He was also married to a ""sweet"" country gal from my home country. My mom, was the one helping everyone in the family, and they only contact her when they need her.  🙄

My uncle was in a nursing home (w advanced parkingson's), and there was a sudden uptick in calls (this never happens btw) from him in getting a lawyer and drafting a will. Repeated requests for help. Me and my mom visited my uncle, to talk to him about it. He said, he wanted to sell the house that they lived in, and wanted to divide the $$ from the sale to my cousin and his sweet wife and my aunt. His reasoning,""Because they are poor and needed the $$ to buy their own home."" Suffice to say, my mom didnt help him, as she knew they were trying to sell the house from under my aunt's nose. The main culprit....plot twist, was his wife. 

They have since divorced (she cheated on him), had 2 kids together.  I got her side of the story, and realized they are both dysfunctional characters.

When did you find out that someone in your family is evil?,"Not my family, but one I was very close to. One of my friends had a mother, who has since passed, who got a divorce with my friend's dad when my friend was 13/14. His mom is pretty fucked up, and she went away for a while until my friend was in his late 20s. Then she showed up out of nowhere, attached to some other guy, who was a complete scumbag. But he left her when she got cancer later on, so.. 

... but anyway, she was one of those people who would become a ""confidant"" and then spill those secrets to other people to become \*their\* confidant. And she did this, solely, to make people fight. She would even make up things, and my friend would have to nail down what was going on because he knew his mom was meddling in some way. She tried to turn his kids against him, his wife, and his dad (her ex-husband). And when her ex and my friend got into a fight of her design, she'd giggle gleefully and clap like a toddler watching a pair of clowns. 

Even her own grandkids were not sacred to her. She used to ""babysit"" the kids, but let them go out and do what they want, and then reported them as runaways. She used to ""confide"" in one sibling to another that the other sibling hated them and said all kinds of mean things. She kept telling my friend his kids were taking drugs and drinking. Just... awful behavior.

My friend needs top secret clearance to do his job, and because his mom traveled a lot between the US and her country of birth, she was always under scrutiny and she had to provide paperwork about her whereabouts, which she'd purposefully withhold just to be in power over her grown son. This caused countless headaches where my friend had to claim his mom was mentally ill and yanking them around. I believe when the investigators asked her standard questions, by the time they were done, they knew she was crazy and making stuff up just for the attention. But when you have TS clearance, you have to re-apply every 5 years, so it would start all over again.

I used to think she loved his sister more, but when the mother finally died, my friend's sister could not say anything nice about her. Instead, did her best to be diplomatic about her mom's ""peculiarities"" and just avoided questions as best she could. But you could tell by the time the service was over, everyone was relieved my friend's mom was finally out of that family's lives.",1,0,629,629,,629,punkwalrus,onlyusemefeets,0

What conspiracy theory is so outrageous it might just be true?,"there are some conspiracy theories that have gained a following due to their outrageousness and the possibility that they may be true. One such theory is the idea that powerful individuals or groups are working to create a ""new world order"" or global government, which would consolidate power and control over the world's resources and population.  
  
This theory suggests that the world's governments, banks, and other institutions are controlled by a shadowy cabal of elites who are working behind the scenes to shape the course of human history. Supporters of this theory point to the influence of organizations like the Bilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission, as evidence of a global conspiracy to create a single world government.  
  
While there is no concrete evidence to support this theory, some people believe that the influence of these groups is evidence of a larger plot to control the world. However, it's important to remember that conspiracy theories like this can be harmful, as they can spread misinformation and distrust in legitimate institutions and leaders, and distract from real-world issues and problems that require attention and action.",1,0,270,270,,270,R1xelf,Western_Tomato2437,0

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","Went to school with a kid called Michael who strangled himself in class with a shoelace. Like purple face and forcefully doing it.

One time he broke his arm and had a cast. Got into an argument with another kid and he just started bashing him with the broken arm. Really hard. 

The teacher tried to get him to leave and go to the principal's office. He refused, so she moved the entire class next door and left him there. So he barricaded the door and started trashing the classroom. The projectile monitors, ripping whiteboards off the wall, flipping tables. 

After 30 mins the police arrived and he was coloring in, bouncing his feet looking happy. Waving to kids outside the window looking in. The police broke the door down and he jumped on the table then attacked them.

Never saw him again after that one. Dude was nuts.

Edit: I remember too, before he barricaded the room an assistant teacher (for kids with issues) went in to talk to him and he started kicking/punching her. She ran out and that's when he started barricading the room in a fit of rage.",6190,0,3871,3871,,3871,MyFingerYourBum,Advanced_Bad4443,0
"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","Was in my office one day when a kid I’d never met before strolled in. Very quickly I recognized by his behavior that he was a BD (behavioral deficit) student who somehow got out of his class. 

He started a conversation with me asking who I was and what I did. I could tell he was trying very hard to get under my skin as he emptied a box of tissues one by one. So I didn’t react. He then kicked over a number of trash cans so I didn’t react. He went into my office bathroom while talking to me with the door open (not to use it), and started messing with the supplies in there, I walked over so I could get a clear view, he then tried to pull the sink off the wall while telling me that he has compulsion issues and has a really hard time not doing the things he thinks about but knows are wrong. He said last year he was expelled from his school because he threw his desk at another student. He told me sometimes he imagines what it would be like to brutalize and murder someone. 

Eventually he tired and realized the sink wasn’t coming down. I kept talking to him and asked if he would like to help me clean up the mess on the floor or if he wanted to go back to class. He helped me clean and then I took him for a walk back to his class. 

That kid took a lot of work over four years by a lot of people. Therapy and medication included. He eventually learned impulse control and learned the differences between craving negative and positive attention from people. He left BD and got to be in general classes, became an athlete, got some real friends, and graduated. I honestly cried when I saw him get his diploma.

I tend to get down on the floor and play with the kids. Seeing an opportunity he latched on to my ear and tore little bits of flesh with his tiny fingernails. I bled. 

I tried talking to his Mom. She says ""yeah he gets rowdy""....

Just this past week I had him in my room again. He delighted in making another boy cry. Refused to participate in our activities. Only wanting to throw toys directly at my face. 

Once I did convince him to participate he clung to me. It was bizarre and honestly made me very sad. 

I talked to some other teachers who've known them longer. Apparently Mom and Dad are serious alcoholics, he is an only child and desperate for attention. 

They all know about his outbursts and violent tendencies but there's really nothing anyone can do because he is 3. 

I'm just going to try my best with him. Maybe a positive influence and some consistency will give this little guy some reassurance.

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","Not a teacher but a therapist who USED to work for a state hospital for children, but now left...


I had 4 kids


Kid 1. He was a 13-year-old who had severe aggression and ADHD. His parents were divorced, dad wanted nothing to do with him, and mom was an overprotector who was a holistic medicine dermatologist who demanded I call her Dr. (NAME) every time I call her. Their son was hospitalized due to him beating up small children and fighting teachers. He was at my state hospital for a week where he would terrorize staff, and children, and would cause lock out between security and him. I tried calling his parents, but his dad had our number blocked (I knew this because when I called him on my phone it rang longer, he answered, then hung up. When I called him again, it said number not in use.) And his mom only answered the phone late in the evening outside of work hours. Mom would get stories about what would happen at work and she demanded to get a call from me. One day we finally got a call from mom and she's screaming at me on how she ""sweet little boy was a victim of society"" and I'm a horrendous therapist. She told the boy everything. The boy said ""lol... my mom said you suck. I'll be our of here soon."" Mom removed him from the hospital where he was hospitalized by child protective services again. The state called me to ask why did I discharge. I told them he was discharged due to parents removing him from program prematurely. Last I heard kid was in Juvi and mom is trying to buy him out.


2. I had a 9 year old who severe aggression. He held grudges and promised to kill other kids. He was sent to my hospital after choking a kid unconscious. I barely got back from a 3 week vacation and my supervisor had this kid unassigned for 3 weeks with no paperwork filed such as notes, intake, progress, and so on. They threw him in my caseload. 1 week later my supervisor demanded i release the kid because ""he been here long enough"". I fought against it because this kid wasn't improving from what I heard. They discharged him instead. Kid was returned to us a week later after trying to kill the same kid again.


3. This kid was 12 years old who was exposed to porn and sexually molested by older women for 6 years because his father thought he was gay. This kid would masturbate in the hallway to shock people, grope other kids, sneak in a phone and watch porn loudly, tried to remove the tops on some girls or pants them. He wasn't on my caseload, but the therapist in charge of them quit on the spot and walked out because they demanded help with this case and many others. She was denied. She left to protect their license in the long run. The hospital discharged this kid to a lower level of care where he tried to rape another client. 


4. One kid who was 12 was the definition of a sociopath. He just loved to hurt other kids. He one day grabbed the balls of this kid with autism. The kid with autism shouted with a loud scream and beat the sociopathic kids to a bloody pulp. Sociopath kid recovers after 3 days, is readmitted to our program where he goes back to the same kid just to touch his balls again and gets a second black eye. He never cried, he never got scared, he just loved what he did.

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","I'd like to say there wasn't one defining instance but more of a long list of them that when everything was over and I had time to relax and process everything did I come to the realization that in 20 maybe 10 years time I'd see this little boy as a teen or a man on the news for murder. I had this one student let's call him Timmy, Timmy was prone to extreme violent outbursts for little to no reason at all and they were so unpredictable that I had to set up a Timmy evacuation protocol with my other students incase I felt their lives were in danger. These are some of the times I had to use this protocol.


Before timmy was banned in my room from using pencils and safety scissors, he went on a rampage with a pencil. He was trying to stab another classmate because I helped her with her writing before him. He was doing his writing just fine, and seconds before that, I had told him, ""Great job, Timmy, I love how you are keeping your letters on the lines."" He didn't need help, and he never once asked for it. Thankfully, the little girl was not hurt as I was right there and was able to throw my hand in front of her face where he was aiming. However, he did get me and the pencil lead was left in my hand. 


Timmy attempted to choke another child because that child was using a red crayon, so instead of getting an identical red crayon from the bucket infront of him he tackled that child out of his chair and put his hands on his neck while screaming like a banshee. 


About a week after the choking incident, he was upset because he wanted to be the only one in class, so he pushed a shelf that I, as a grown adult, have trouble moving over in an attempt to in his words ""squish"" his classmates who were working on the carpet. (Thankfully, I was able to hold it up while they ran). He proceeded to destroy my entire room, to the point where I decided to just move classrooms for the day as it would have been impossible to clean it up and frankly I didn't want my already traumatized students to come in and witness it.


Every single day, this child would have a violent meltdown. Some were more contained to himself, a small area or me personally. (edit: I am a UPK teacher. This child was 4 years old)",2464,0,3871,3871,,3871,VanillaRose33,Advanced_Bad4443,0
"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","Kid was whispering shit to the boys he sat next to. Had no idea until one had a breakdown about how no one loved him and the other started bed wetting and having panic attacks about going to school. This was emotional brutality, and what the teacher referred to as the last type of bullying he was trying out before he would be isolated from the other kids if he showed no remorse.

When this boy was spoken to, he smirked the entire time. Thought it was funny. Never wanted to punch a 7 year old before or since. He'd make friends with stupid kids and make them do violent or damaging things for his amusement then watch as they got into trouble. I went overnight from normal teaching assistant to policing that boys every move all day. If his eyes weren't on his work, he was being told off. He was not allowed to interact with younger children or children his own age. Older kids didn't put up with him. It seems cruel, but he had been like this for three years, and every other option had been exhausted, to the detriment of every child this boy came across. The only interaction he was allowed was group work and it was closely supervised. 

He was expelled from every secondary school he went to, his mother went bald from the stress (parents were the sweetest people, they tried so hard) and he was in juvie from 14 to 18. He does multiple petty crimes and damaging things.

Last I heard he had to go into hiding because he organised a bunch of traveller kids he had befriended to help steal a quadbike. When they were chased down, the bike owner got macheted.

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","Maybe not a seriel killer but let me talk about James(Name changed), he would most certainly one day explode on society as things didn't work out the way he wanted.

James was full of temper tantrums. On an average day he'd go through usually 2-3 over the most mundane of things. James was 5 years old so should have had a grasp on this, but we'll go into why at the end.

James had to be 1st in line, every time. If he wasn't he was screaming, fighting and in a panick. When we designated a student for 1st he had to be second and the same above would happen. When he was 1st, he'd push and yell at the other students. It made lining up hell.

James would make messes and demand fairness. Often time reverting in a hysterical tempur tantrum of sptting, hitting, and crying if another student who was near him didn't also clean up.

He had a weird way of eating with just his hands, it didn't bother me, but when the other teacher asked him to use a fork, he'd pick up the fork with one hand and just move it up and down while continuing to eat using just the other hand.

James was clever and vindicitive. Often asking to go to the bathroom when we were going outside, or the class was chaotic. When he'd go he'd either steal something or break other students creations.

He also had a fascination with toothpaste and toothbrushes, especially of other students. He would often try to clean the toilet bowel with the other students, and dump the toothpaste in the bath. You'd think he'd be sick all the time because he didn't wash his hands but he managed to build up a good immune system because

James licked the ground, a lot. And almost everything else especially if he was feeling vindictive or provacative.

The hardest part though was the absolute lack of participation of his helicopter mother who blamed everyone else for her sons problems. When we worked with the father, he and the other teachers created a present system, if he was good and listened in school then he got a present at the end of the day. Father stored the presents in the car but when the mother came, she didn't care and let her son open up all the presents defeating the whole purpose.

She also actively talked to her son about how much she hated the school and teachers. Which meant every painfully earned inch with her child, turned into miles and often the trust built between us was turned back. 

They were eventually expelled though as the mother, to prove a point of her distrust, started to drop him into random classes in the school ignoring some teachers, yelling at others, and pushing him in randomly to classes and leaving him like that. Usually mid-temper tantrum and curled up somewhere in the school for us to find or another teacher to deal with.",734,0,3871,3871,,3871,Mixedstereotype,Advanced_Bad4443,0
"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","5 years ago I had a 2nd grader who was horribly violent. I couldn’t get a straight answer as to his home life and I was the new teacher so there was a lot kept from me. He would attack classmates with whatever was handy. Since I was the art teacher I’d see his class 1x a week. I had to precut everything, not use pencils or brushes because they were potentially weapons. I learned by process of elimination what not to put out and my cabinets had to be locked. One day I caught him trying to stab a girl on the head (walking slowly arm raised) another time he had a chair ready to bring but down on another kid’s head. I grabbed the chair and he full on attacked me. Bit me, split my lip, punched, kicked….the principal let him “walk it off” The following week he told his classmates he was going to try and kill me. Again, nothing happened. This kid had serious brain issues.the wiring was off. His eyes were dead or malicious. His movements were methodical for a child. I know that children who act out are usually victims of trauma, but this kid was born with something wrong. The worst part? Everyone knew he was dangerous but just basically ignored him. 
The principal told me to just watch him but not to neglect the other 23 kids. I left that shitty job. Oh and FUCK YOU JENNIFER L. Principal of the elementary school. You are a fucking piece of shit for allowing kids at that school to do whatever the hell they wanted with zero consequences.

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","I have a kid (8yo) like that in my class this year. All his time at school he has been a troublesome kid, hurting other kids without being provoked, unpredictable mood changes, and he's really hard to read. Lots of teacher collegues say he looks dead in the eyes, no expressions of joy or any other emotions.. 

The moment that really shocked me, was when an other student had found a fly in the playround. The fly was hurt and couldn't fly anymore. So this student gave it a name (Henkie) and started to care for it, very sweet. Lots of classmates joined in taking care of the fly and helping it (making a house out of leaves etc). I gave the kids some magnifying glasses so they could take a nice look and encouraged the kids' curiosity and gentleness. 

This kid also came over to 'take a look' and was told to be careful, because Henkie was the other students' friend. He looked for 2 secs, grinned and stomped on it.

Worst part is that Henkie didn't even die (or at least it was still twitching). So the other student kept on trying to nurse his little buddy back to health. He even took it inside to read it a story. My heart just broke by the love this student was showing for this little creature, but the kid didn't seem to care at all about what he did. 

This was a couple of months ago, and he still even kind of brags about when he (almost) killed Henkie. This kid just gives me the chills.",187,0,3871,3871,,3871,Snackichu,Advanced_Bad4443,0
"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","I've told this story before but I was once watching two young students playing. Igor would put a box on Toms heads and then tom would take it off and they would both laugh. Igor repeated this a few times and finally tom put it on Igors head and tom laughed. Igor, still with a smile on his face picked up some Christmas tinsel, removed the gold bands revealing just a wire and then wrapped it around Tom's neck and pulled it back like a garrote strangling for a moment before I could break it up. It wasn't the only incident and he was expelled from the school after leaving scars from multiple clawings of other students. His mother in tears couldn't seem to understand the problem and blamed the school because we weren't ""strict enough"" and that he behaved well at home because of how ""strict"" the father was.

They were four years old.

A happier story, I had a returned student who had been cheerful and happy in my class although with the occasional temper tantrum, come back after a stint in a public school(Vietnamese). It was like the charm and light in his eyes had gone out. He could still be motivated to work and pursued a lot of things but if he felt slighted, like someone didn't like his drawings, I'd have to watch him closely as he'd find things other children loved or cared about and would destroy him. Projects etc. It made me nervous to see such malice in my student but still I searched for things to inspire him, and keep him following the rules and learning in class. He learned I can't stand boogers though and would mid-temper tantrum attempt to rub them over everything, but still kept on teaching, and working with him. After he left my school I kept on teaching him privately and over time found a great strategy for teaching him. Now we learn online and he chooses the topic, and we learn together via youtube videos, games etc and he has burned through many amazing topics in history and science for the sake of learning English. We've done world history from the Peloponnesian war all through the Cold war, and we just recently finished learning about Justinian and his general Balisarius, asking questions about ruling, social policies, and navigating politics. He questions everything and comes back with curiosity and interest in the lesson in the same way when I started with him.

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","So I wasn’t a school teacher, I was a head teacher is childcare for 6 years. The first 2 years I was in the preschool room and floated to the older kids (6-12years) before I went to toddler permanently. I had this kid who was a foster child. Came from a really bad backround. His mom had 5 kids. 3 youngests were boys and were his fathers kids. The 2 older girls were his fathers step kids. Reading their reports I learned his father would rape the older sisters and mom would allow it, and he would beat the boys. Further reading, it stated this kid had microwaved their cat. He had bad behavioral issues. Further down in the report when his social worker would come take them to talk to them, he ended up putting a chair through a window. In the class room at the daycare he would purposely shit his pants. Tell other kids he was going to kill them and grabbed them by the neck. He’s told me he was going to hurt me, with straight eye contact. He would fly off the hinges so bad my boss would have to retrain him until his social worker got there with police and his foster parents. 

I always said we were going to be on his hit list in a few years. Him and his brothers were adopted by their foster parents and ended up moving away. I don’t know how he’s doing now or what happened

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","Kid in 5th grade (11 years old) very intelligent and in gifted classes. He would torment the other gifted kids.  The only time I ever saw his creepy, dead eye, jack o lantern smile was when he made another kid cry. He would do things like - finish a book over the weekend that the other kid was reading just so he could come in and spoil the ending. He researched some country that this kids grandparents came from and called him a nazi (it wasn’t Germany - can’t remember). The other kids parents did the nice kid thing: just ignore him. And god love them these kids tried. He would chase them on the playground just to say creepy shit. Anyway I came in 1/2 way through the year. I called a meeting with the parents and school social worker. They said the other kids bullied him!

He is definitely going to kill prostitutes or hide bombs somewhere.  After he went to middle school there were a bunch of bomb threats.

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","Sorry for another “not a teacher” story, buttttt… 

I remember I was in 7th grade (so around 11-12 years old) and we were sitting in my social studies class (history) going over some of the current events. My school had some special education ones mixed in with the regular learners in the classes that didn’t require extra assistance, now I don’t think this kid was ‘disabled’ by normal means but he definitely wasn’t okay upstairs and needed help rationalizing things and orienting tasks. 

This particular afternoon we were leading a story called “I am Malala”, if unfamiliar it is about a 15 year Pakistani girl who vocalized her displeasure with the Taliban and their retaliation toward her. He was kinda talking to himself, in his own world for an important part of the reading and my teacher was quite irritated he wasn’t giving her the respect of following along and eventually kinda snapped at him and told him he was acting like a child and he needed to show respect as this was important.

He kinda gives some mumbles back to her, something that sounds like ‘okay’ or maybe ‘sorry’. As he’s finishing this up she continues to read the passage  and reads the part where the Taliban end up shooting Malala. In the face. From 3 feet away. This kids starts BUSTING out laughing, just hysterically. He then stops and goes “She, she *actually* got shot in the face? Like for real? That’s hilarious!” The classroom is silent. This is kid is still at least half way laughing. I remember gritting my teeth and feeling pretty awkward *for* him. Everyone else around me mouths’ were dropped open and I’ll never forget the twisted face of disgust and confusion my teacher had on her face as she tried to process what had happened and how to continue with the reading.",104,0,3871,3871,,3871,RacialPanda20,Advanced_Bad4443,0
"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","Alt account, am a teacher. 

1. When they would attempt to stab a student out of the blue. As in, no anger, no tantrum, no sadness, just sitting there calmly and then acting. And then having absolutely zero emotions after. Not crying, not having a tantrum, just blank. That emotionless void is the scariest.

2. The eyes. It’s always the eyes. 

On a sidenote, blame shifting has been an increasing issue. As a teacher, I am obligated to first report to my higher-ups if there’s any issues. Once they step in, my hands are effectively tied. Luckily my administration usually takes the proper actions, but other administrations have not, and it’s frustrating. 

I’ve also seen it from the parent side, where parents assume that the teacher or another student has made their child make the bad decision, so the kid knows that their parents will back them up no matter what.  Conversely, ones who have reacted so harshly over in minor thing, like forgetting homework, that you can see why the kid just gives up and does whatever the hell they want. I had a student a few years ago where the parents would actively brag about throwing away all of their holiday presents in front of them, because they got a B on a test. We called CPS, they found nothing. The student was savvy enough to realize that their parents were crazy, so they just did worse and worse things because no matter what they did, the punishment was extreme and over the top.

Bottom line - parents have more sway than teachers over discipline issues that negatively impact the education and safety of their own child. If your child is coming home reporting of horrid tales about a child, confirm it with other parents, then start calling. Teachers can’t talk to you about other children, but if you know how to read between the lines, they will often let things slip that they shouldn’t. The teacher might tell you something like, “I understand what you are saying, and I urge you to call the principal and let them know your concerns.” That’s code for “I’m not allowed to confirm nor deny, but please call and help me out here.”  The teachers have probably done everything in their power and if the child is on an IEP or something, their hands are tied. Schools fear negative press, I hate to say it, but that’s sometimes the only way to get a severely disturbed child out.",161,0,3871,3871,,3871,Ill_Temporary4215,Advanced_Bad4443,0

Tons of unreasonable and scary violent outbursts. Held a knife to my mom's throat once, tried to beat friends of mine to death and generally was a huge problem but I was small so some people ignored the threat but others made things worse by never talking and always assuming the worst.

My dad beat me at home but would smile for social services so nothing ever came of it. I was adopted and came with issues nobody tried to find out for a long time. I was a small nerd so at school I would get best up and admin never did anything so by 8 or so I responded the only way I knew how and I got more and more vicious about it. The speak got bad, I was in mental hospitals, expelled and ostracized which made the beatings worse of course.

At 16 I finally got a psychologist that could speak to me and I got involved in a local native tribe that helped me gain some perspective and I was finally able to feel like I had some control and took that control straight to drugs.

I'm 43, married with amazing kids (way better then I ever was) and it turns out instead of being near sociopathic, I am massively over empathic and the abuse made me shut it off until I was in my 30s.

After the first couple I started looking over at her kid when she told these stories and there was just something... Off about the reactions. I dunno. Like the kid was enjoying hearing the story. Like... ""I've got a secret"" kind of look. This kid was 10-14 when I knew them.

He is back in with the general public and has wreaked havoc on our school. He throws fits daily and does not do any work. He is now attending school only for a half day because his behaviour during the second half of the day was escalating. 

His EA quit/switched positions because of him. He called her a variety of swear words and other unsavory names in the hallway for all students to hear. He threw desks, chairs and other items at her and regularly hit her with his hat, books, and other items he could get. He also regularly rips down student work from the walls and tears them up or crumples them. He used to be allowed in the library to “calm down” and began destroying that as well. He would throw books around and at people, threw computers and their accessories (breaking multiple) and eventually broke a display and hit a teacher over the head with a piece of wood that caused her to bleed. He has also broken staff ipads and chromebooks by bending them in half and hitting them or throwing them.

I don't remember what we were talking about, it was maybe 17 years ago.

Well call the suspected killer SK.

As we are walking, SK comes up behind Erika(fake name) and grabs her around the neck. We all stop as he mumbles some incel shit and puts an opened box cutter to her neck.

I'm running my mouth fast about how long I've known him, how this is a bad idea, how he needs to stop and think about what he's doing. He finally lets his guard down and lowers the blade. Erika runs off to the stage as fast as she can, everyone but me following.

I just stared at him. This guy who I've known for years, spent time at his house, knew him as a friend. He just started at me with nothing in his eyes. He tried to reason with me as though we were in some invisible struggle together, fighting some pumped up adversary which was all in his head.

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","It wasn't one thing in particular but a combination of the following:  


1. Would purposely hurt his classmates then laugh about it/try to play innocent. He pushed a disabled boy over so hard that when he hit the back of his head on the concrete it gave him a concussion and black eyes. He was out of school for over a week and the kid thought it was funny.
2. Caught him playing with his poop multiple times (I taught pre-k so we had bathrooms inside the classroom and if a kid was taking an abnormal amount of time I would check on them)
3. Would do the thing narcs do where they do something horrible and then turn on the charm and try to act super sweet to anybody who doesn't see through their bullshit.
4. Took great pleasure in waiting until the class was down for a nap and then would get up and jump from cot to cot waking everyone up and hurting them in the process because he would come down on them feet first. (This is what got him moved to my class because I would keep his cot by my feet and watch him like a hawk. It kept the peace but also fed into the need for attention he had.)
5. Told us his parents locked him in his room at night so that he wouldn't hurt his little brother but then they would always make excuses for him and say he wasn't the problem. They have fucked that kid up for sure.

I will never forget his evil smile and will watch the news for his name until the day I die. He'd be 12 this year so I'll probably be regularly googling his name from now on.

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","I feel like this is the perfect thread to express this, but teachers, when a student comes up to you and says “hey so and so said ___” and it happens to be something like “I’m gonna burn your house down” or “I’m gonna slit your throat.” It doesn’t matter if they’re in special education or not, they need to be talked to. 

There was a specific instance when another student, two years younger than I at the time, told me in front of my friends that he was going to slit my throat and burn my house down while we were eating lunch for no apparent reason. This student did not have any conditions or concerns of the such, but was in the special education classes. Said person still thought it was okay to say such things frequently, not just to myself. When I talked to someone that day and said it was concerning to me and others, I was accused of being a bully and causing him to act out and they would never do such a thing. When I said ask any of the other students that were sitting nearby what they heard, the teachers completely ignored what I said and nothing was ever done. I can count over a dozen times where someone else said something about him threatening someone or the school without anything being said.

Toddlers and pre schoolers are a different bunch. You have your biters but it was a behaviour that usually changed within a couple weeks. 

There was this one boy who was different though. This boy enjoyed inflicting pain on the other kids. Whenever other kids would bite, you’d see the anger in their faces while they were going for it. Not this boy. He’d be laughing. He’d also head butt the other kids and pull their hair. This boy was incapable of showing affection to any person or even object. I remember the daycare workers trying to explain “gentle touches” to him where they touch his arm. He’d respond by hitting them. 

They basically had to have an ECA watching him at all times. Everyone would hold their breath whenever he approached another kid. It was a very sad situation to see a 2 year old like that.",15,0,3871,3871,,3871,PewpyDewpdyPantz,Advanced_Bad4443,0

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","Yeah, so not a teacher here. But my sister is an occupational therapist, and worked with special needs students in a school system. The students were all under the age of 10. This one student was 6 and had been referred to my sister's program because he was completely nonverbal. If he wanted something, he might point to it and grunt. So a speech therapist was working extensively with him, but all the staff was aware that there was something seriously wrong with this kid. No affect, except once when another child stumbled and got a bloody nose. The weird kid laughed this really creepy laugh.

They held a conference with the mother, discussing treatment goals and plans. Now this is at a US school, but the parents were British, very well educated and classy. The mother starts going on and on about how she had **some** concerns about mealtime, but maybe it was nothing. And her husband had pooh-poohed her concerns: ""At least he's eating his vegetables."" And maybe he would grow out of it. And she natters on in this posh British accent, but not really saying anything. Finally, my sister said, ""**What** are you talking about?""

It seems that at mealtime, the child would climb up onto the table, crawl around, scooping food out of the serving dishes with his bare hands and also sticking his face into a dish and eating like a dog. But Daddy says he will eventually eat like a human and he is eating his vegetables.

We had this seven year old kid would throw a huge tantrum every time he didn’t get his way. If anyone said no to him for anything he would attack you, destroy the room for about an hour or so. 
He beat up his mom constantly. One day on school property when she told him he couldn’t attend football for his behaviors, He beat her black and blue. It took three teachers to get him off of her. He was put into an institution for a short period. 


In my school now…

-this child would draw gravestones of kids in the class and different ways they would die. He threatened them all the time. He talked about blowing up the school or setting fire to it. He actually did last year with a lighter and toilet paper and was finally expelled. 

-this other kid targets everyone in his class and smacks, hits, pushes, punches, anything physical within the span of three hours of being in school everyday. He knows who to target and how to set them off. He shows no remorse, sadness, guilt, or anything remotely emotional to show empathy- he does not care. 
His psychologist has said “I’ve never seen a child that lacks empathy like this.”







I think what some folks don’t realize is- if you cannot control or help with these behaviors, may they be taught or an actual mental issue/emotional issue this is where a parent has to say this is beyond my control and I need help.

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","So, funny story. 

I used to teach GED classes in a prison, and over the years had more than a handful of students who were in for murder or manslaughter. No serial killers tho, they were in a higher security prison than I was at. 

Most of murderers I worked with hadn't premeditated their crime, but we're spur of the moment kinds of things. Shooting or a wife or girlfriend during an argument (or in one case, walking in on them with another guy and shooting the guy), drunken fights where someone pulls a knife, drunk driving and they hit a car and kill someone, that kind of thing. They were all pretty average and normal guys, but some of them had anger issues that they still needed to work on. 

It's interesting that the prison system requires every inmate who doesn't have a diploma to be working on or obtain their GED while in prison, even if they have a life sentence. They generally lose their parole date if they refuse, but lifers don't have a parole date so don't have much to lose. It's really cool to see the these guys work hard and improve themselves, even though they know they're never going to get out of prison. Getting their GED is still an accomplishment, and can make them feel like they're at least doing something positive. Some guys do eventually get their sentences overturned or reduced and do get out, and can make use of their education, but odds of that are pretty slim. 

The vast majority of my students were short timers, though, and were released back into society fairly quickly. It was pretty rewarding to know that I made a difference in their lives and improved the odds of them finding a good/meaningful job, so they can go on to live normal lives, provide for their families, and contribute to society.",49,0,3871,3871,,3871,PoisonWaffle3,Advanced_Bad4443,0

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","I taught a student once, let's call him Joe. Joe was odd right from the beginning. He didn't do anything for the longest time except struggle academically. I tried interventions with mixed results. When I tried to talk to mom about these concerns she went straight to ""I'll never agree to him getting tested"". Ok ...so I just keep doing what I can. One day I find a crumpled up piece of paper on my desk and as I'm getting ready to throw it away I open it and see it's from Joe. He wrote ""I have no friends I want to die"". I immediately launch into suicide protocol and the counselor did an assessment and called home. Dad yelled at her saying it's the schools fault. Mom comes and picks him up. Well, he has no friends because he's mean. Then, a while later he told an autistic student,""I could kill your whole family and no one would know"". Kid rightfully freaked out. I involved admin and they interviewed both boys. Joes reply was ""that's mean, I'd never say that"". Admin said it was a he said/ he said situation so nothing was done.

One of the 8 year olds we had to actively stop from killing animals every day he was there, and my coworker would sit him down and tell him not to kill animals. His mother went to our boss and complained that we were “disciplining her son” and said “how dare you discipline my son!” And apparently tried to get us fired.

Kid: Chocolate!

Me: Oh! Actually, dogs can’t eat chocolate. It can make them very sick and even kill them. 

Kid: I know! (while smiling and laughing).

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","Not as a teacher but a fellow student. We were playing a game, and we were in a classroom on our own, and I had to step out to make a phone call because my relative was ill.

He turned the shark eyes on me and said, ""I don't care."" He has blue eyes, but at that moment, his eyes were almost entirely black, flat, and completely devoid of any expression except contempt.

That sounds like nothing, but the fear it instilled in me was overwhelming. I made my call, but I stayed in the next door room for ages trying to calm my heart palpitations and eyeing up alternative routes out of the building which didn't involve me going past the room he was in again. I could not make my body return to the room where that *thing* was waiting, even though, objectively, he had just said something a little insensitive. My body was in full fight or flight mode.

Eventually, the fear that he had heard me stop talking and was wondering where I was and the fact that all my stuff apart from my phone was in the room with him made me go back in. The only door I could get out was a fire door and I was afraid opening it would set off an alarm.

That's a decision I regretted, as it was the beginning of a short abusive relationship, which was then followed by years of stalking and harassment which continued even when he was in the military. I honestly believe he let me see behind the mask, and from that point on, he couldn't let me live in peace. The abuse was physical, sexual and especially psychological. Even now, when my phone buzzes I get a shiver, I literally moved out of the country partly to make it harder for him to track me down, but as we have mutual friends from school/hometown, it's never impossible. It's slightly easier to impress on people that he should not know where I am as he's been up on charges of rape/sexual assault and stalking of another ex. The charges were dropped, but at least I can point to them to bolster my own case.  At the beginning, people were way too eager to get us back in touch as ""he's so moody since you left."" If I'd stayed, I'd be dead, Patricia. He'd be even moodier without me then. 

If someone makes the little hairs on the back of your neck spike, believe your instincts, drop everything, and never interact with them again. He was a burning building, and I went back in for my bag, basically, which you should never do.",40,0,3871,3871,,3871,Sherpa2730,Advanced_Bad4443,0

No problem,  I thought,  and she took them home over the weekend. 

Monday rolls around, and she brought them back and said that she felt that Marx was 'just missing something'. This led to a short discussion, and she then asked to borrow my copy of Trotsky's*History of the Russian Revolution*. She kept it for a couple of weeks, brought it back, and said it wasn't quite right... then asked to borrow my old college copy of *Mien Kampf* with my old notations. 

I expressly warned her about the dangerous allue of the book, especially if I knew enough but not *quite* enough. She promised it was just academic curiosity, so I relented. The only time in my eight year career I loaned that book out.  

For weeks, I see her and a group of girls (from her so-called book club) religiously pouring over and discussing that damn book. Discussing at a damn high level of understanding too.

So I practice martial arts and I found a book titled Black Medicine: The Dark Art of Death.

I had already known about a few weak points on the body (mostly from getting hit there or accidentally hitting someone else there) and I was curious if it was listed in there, I was a little surprised when it was. I then decided to try out something I could do on myself and it hurt pretty bad. There actually wasnt much lethal techniques in the book besides what was covered on weapons so I thought it would be useful. I bought the book and took it to school the next day and one of my teachers (he teaches multiple science subjects, including anatomy) noticed what I was reading. He asked if he could take a look at the book so I handed it to him. After flipping through a couple pages he looked at me and said ""Do I need to call the student counselor?"" I said ""it's not as bad as it looks"" and he looked at the cover and read out loud ""the Dark Art of Death"".

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","I’ve met two kids who I firmly believe could become serial killers…


- The first was the counselor’s grandson. Her office was though my classroom. Often if she stayed late to work her grandchildren would hand out in my classroom. Most of the time they were fine. They would help with some cleaning and stacking chairs, we’d talk about our days, sometimes they’d play on the school iPads in my room. It was fine until they stopped following boundaries I had set. For example, the iPads were running low on battery so I had put them in the locked cart to charge and the oldest grandson had a temper tantrum over wanting to play with it. Whenever the oldest grandson would get upset he would say really evil things and get really overly emotional and aggressive. His response was typically far greater than the actual problem. Finally his grandmother no longer allowed them in my room due to his behavior and when she told him he had this huge blowup. I remember thinking that this kid can’t handle any upset and his dad is a cop. He’s totally going to become a school shooter one day.



- The second was a student I had during the first school year post Covid. He was fine for me; he acted like the rest of the students. The only thing that was different is that his video would turn off more frequently and during parent/teacher conferences his parents asked for advice for his bad behavior. Come the second semester he switched to in person schooling at our same school. He would get incredibly upset when asked to follow any direction or do any work. He ended up being so violent that the teacher had to evacuate the other kids almost daily. Finally in first grade, he attacked and hurt every first grade teacher and multiple students across the course of the year, including stabbing a kid with a pencil and throwing a chair at a teacher. Over the protests of his parents he was finally moved to a school that specializes in challenging behaviors. When the story about the kid shooting his teacher in Virginia came out I had to double check that it wasn’t him.

He would “snap” and become extremely violent towards others. Once you had been around him for a while you could see it coming and head it off, sometimes.

I think?) to school in his backpack because he thought it was funny. thing was crawling with maggots, and looked like it had had its neck snapped. He also brought a human skull to school once. I was looking at it with my anatomy teacher (who was also my homeroom teacher) and as far as they could tell it was real, and from a young adult. there were severe fractures to the skull. 

he also wrote manifestos over 100 pages long about how awful humanity was and how he dreamed of burning people alive and torturing them, and how it would be better for humanity. He also sent a picture around the school of himself with a dead snake in his mouth. 

Everyone else thought he was ""quirky"" and hilarious. I swore from the day I met him that one day bodies would get dug up in his backyard. I'm currently in college, and from what i've heard from kids in my hometown who still speak to him he's still just as creepy and the dead animals have started increasing in frequency and size. And since he's also a legal adult at a college several states away, adults are far less impressed with the dead and mutilated wildlife and short stories of dissecting the genitals of female classmates.

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","Middle schooler teacher of a very low performing povertish community.

Prior to Covid I had this student “R.”  I am a band director and he played the trombone.  R had a bullshit plan in our school to baby him because no one wanted to face his behavior because of his outbursts.  The plan pretty much was if he stays in class for x amount of time he could leave early to go to a special room and play on his computer every class period. 

I told him I would go with the plan but my stipulation was that he had to actually do something.  He could just sit in his other classes do nothing and then the last 15 minutes go play.  He became destructive of my classroom, my materials and would try to intimidate me by getting in my face.  I didn’t cave and he never improved but I wasn’t doing my job if I just babied him and didn’t try to to make a difference.

Well Covid happened and when we came back we had strict rules on masking in person.  He showed up with only a face shield.  We would not allow him in the building and he went complete ape shit.  Cursing all the words in the book, smashing windows and doors trying to get in.  Broke a window by head butting it and then was handling broken glass as a weapon.

Needless to say police came and he went to a farm home specializing in behavior.

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","I work in early child education. I was working in the toddler department, 2 year olds, I was new to the department, had been working with this company about 4 years at this point. The classroom next door had a child named Joseph. I was the closing room for my department and spent the afternoons with him. This kid looked innocent, but wasn’t. He had this look in his eyes I don’t know how to explain. One day, I see him purposely throwing sand at the other kids and redirected him from the sandbox. I talk to mom at pickup. This kid was sneaky and I would catch him trying to hurt other kids, but also have this look on his face as if he’d done nothing wrong. A couple days later I had to talk her again about his behavior. Then she makes a comment, “I don’t want to blame you, but it’s funny that since they’ve changed this department around he’s been having problems.” The thing was, his primary caregivers never talked to mom about Joseph’s behavior, and one of them would only complain to me about it. After that last interaction with the mom, I told his teachers they needed to start talking to her. The next week, I got spoken to by management about joseph being sent home with a wet diaper. I had documented that he was dry just before mom picked up. It was some bullshit the mom was pulling. I started noticing that she made excuses for Joseph’s behaviors, no matter what is was. He could do no wrong, it was everyone else out to get Joseph. She was always coddling him. This mom was doing everything to raise her child to be a psychopath. I don’t remember other things that had happened, this was 8 years ago, but I remember telling another coteacher I wouldn’t be surprised to see him on the news for being a serial killer. I’d be a character witness. 

Fast forward to Joseph being in preschool. He was being wild there too. Again, I don’t remember much of the details, but I do remember his teachers complained about him and the mom.

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","Sharing a story of a kid who was prevented from being a serial killer - at least for a bit.

My high school one year had an anti-bullying day. The whole day was dedicated to teachers and students talking about bullying and why it should stop. We also had a school wide assembly about it.

In concept it sounds great, but the school really was *not* prepared to do this properly. A lot of the “student leaders” they had speaking out about bullying that day were called out for being bullies at the assembly, and a lot of students would publicly denounce what they felt was “their” form of being bullied (I think one of the most outrageous claims were our cheerleaders saying they were sick of our football players hitting on the other team’s cheerleaders and not them. Let that sink in).

There was one kid though that made the whole school go quiet. He went up to the mic and thanked the entire school for doing the day because he felt so bullied he was researching ways to hurt people. He then went into detail about the research he was doing and how he was going to enact plans to go after specific people, random people, and groups of people. All I remember was a teacher putting an arm around his shoulders, walking him to a side exit…and never seeing that kid again",4,0,3871,3871,,3871,Mintyphresh33,Advanced_Bad4443,0
"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","I went to a middle school (6th to 8th) for kids with learning disabilities; ADD, ADHD, Dyslexia, auditory processing disorders, and other similar learning disabilities. This was (1996-1999) so a lot about what we know now about mental illness in kids wasn’t available back then. For the most part the administration and teachers tried their best. I know there were certain students who made them think twice about going into teaching. 

Unfortunately for a good number of kids, their learning disability came with a diagnosis of one or more; Anxiety, Depression, OCD, Bipolar Disorder (usually poorly managed with medications), Oppositional Defiance Disorder (ODD), Conduct Disorder (CD), Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), CPTSD (Complex PTSD), and Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD). You can imagine what would happen if you put ~30ish 12-14 year olds together; all with one or more learning disabilities and on top of that a good chunk of those kids also have a poorly treated (poorly understood) severe mental illness. It was frequently chaos. I still have no idea how the teachers showed up everyday, because it certainly wasn’t for the paycheck.

Those diagnoses are just from remembering the behaviors of classmates. We had so many kids with severe behavioral issues it was basically their last chance before being sent to an alternative school. I have no idea how the teachers did it. They obviously weren’t paid enough. 

I would honestly say most of my peers came by their disorders honestly. Looking back I feel sorry for a lot of them. The kids with the worst behavioral problems came from dysfunctional homes with parents suffering from undiagnosed mental illnesses. Some of the kids came from families that meant well, but struggled with how to parent a child with multiple mental illnesses, they tried but ultimately were unable to parent their child. Then there were kids who families had a firm grasp on their child’s diagnosis and were advocating for better understanding of their child’s diagnosis. You also have to keep in mind this was the late 90’s and we didn’t know everything we know now about mental illness in children; let alone learning disabilities, severe and otherwise. I believe the majority of the parents really tired to help their kids, but they either didn’t have the resources or knowledge to be more effective. 

It was a mixed bag. I’ve gone back to visit teachers and I’ve stayed in contact with several of my teachers throughout the years. Each of them has told me the same thing, your class (the 8th graders who had been together since 6th grade) was by far the worst, behavioral wise. They’ve never had a group of students who were so unruly and impudent. I believe it.

I’m absolutely certain I went to school with at least one if not 5 or more kids who have murdered someone, are in prison for a violent crime, have been forcibly committed by the state, have/ or are currently involved with some kind of organized crime, and I wouldn’t be surprised to discover some are on a permanent government list.",4,0,3871,3871,,3871,Chiefy_Poof,Advanced_Bad4443,0

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","Not a teacher but I jokingly warned my youngest son’s teachers when he was in primary school (age 4 - 11) that when he grows up he is either going to be famous or infamous. We had known since he was about 2 years old that he had clear signs of autism & ADHD, which was nothing unexpected as there is a strong family history of both. He had always been aggressive at home towards his older brother and towards himself. His brother was good at calming him down and we always dealt with the situations, trying to prevent them as well as diffusing them too. He is very high functioning on the autism scale and otherwise is a very nice natured child.

At school he was usually very calm but hard work. Not a violent child or rude, never answers back or swears etc. until one day when he was 8 years old something happened in class. I don’t know the full details but he suddenly stood up, flipped a table over and then threw his chair across the room. He then shouted out “I want to kill myself”. Needless to say, he was taken from the classroom & into a quiet room until I was called in. The educational psychologist was called straight away for an emergency assessment.

It was only after this incident that he was finally assessed (properly) for autism and diagnosed. As myself and the school had been fighting for years for him to be assessed. He was assessed when he was 3/4 years old in an early years setting, which in our area are notoriously bad for the way they assess the children. So when the Dr told her findings to the school of “he is not autistic” the school asked if she had the correct child’s notes.

Since his diagnosis the schools have been able to put his EHCP into place and everything is going well. He is in a school unit for students with autism that is attached to a secondary school and he is a completely different child.

"Teachers of Reddit, what was the moment you realized “This kid is gonna be a serial killer one day”?","At one of my first teaching jobs I encountered a kid that was isolated by his peers (I didn’t know why at the time). He got beat up a lot as well, which immediately made me so sad. I started to build a connection with him because I saw he was so lonely, and he expressed that rumours had been spread about him that had ruined his reputation at the school. I really felt for the kid because he was always nice and respectful to me, and never caused problems in class. We left that year with a great relationship, he said he trusted me more than he had ever trusted a teacher and his class performance improved. 

I went into the second year excited to teach him. Problems started immediately, saying inappropriate things in class (disgusting things about women, homophobic, transphobic and racial slurs). I would call him out and he would apologize over, and over again. Once day in the principal’s office (as we ended up there together frequently when I would kick him out of class for his behaviour), he was going on about how unfair it was that he got beat up all the time and the school did nothing about it, but he says “ONE THING” and he gets suspended. We tried explaining again to him that although this is unfair, we can’t control things that happen off of school property or outside of school time, and the things he was doing were on school property and during school time. He left the meeting frustrated. 

After he left I was talking to my principal about how I agreed that it was unfair that this kid was getting targeted (for no reason - I thought) and we were doing nothing about it. It was then, (1.5 years after I began teaching this kid) that my principal decided to reveal this student’s backstory. 

He had raped a young family member. Repeatedly. Went through the court system, was on probation. Still lived with that family member. Was not remorseful for his actions/or able to take accountability. 

I was then able to see this student for who he truly was, a master manipulator who was unable to understand why his actions had consequences. He had been isolated by his peers because they knew he had done this horrible thing, and continued to be a disgusting person afterwards. 

I continued to try and connect with this kid. Show him respect. Give him the benefit of the doubt. Even after knowing all this about him. We ended the year with him freaking out and calling me fucking bitch after I finally drew the line and excluded him from class (2 weeks before the semester was over). I had had 3 conversations with him prior to this explosion rationally explaining why he was not going to be included in our classroom any longer, and he was reasonable, agreeable and apologetic in each conversation. I couldn’t believe how unpredictable, explosive and inappropriate his actions were. 

This kid better end up in jail for something stupid and innocuous, or I’m afraid of what other damage he will do throughout his life.",3,0,3871,3871,,3871,LittleGbigworld,Advanced_Bad4443,0

Results take time, and consistency will keep you on track. You can look up tips on how to maintain that daily discipline and hold yourself accountable, or you could work with a personal trainer who'll help you make a plan and stick to it.

As for me, I do full-body resistance training three times a week, cardio training like cycling or walking the other four, and that takes up about an hour of each day.

Strength gains? Anything 1-6 reps and taken to failure.

Power lifting Squat Bench and Deadlift twice a week hit accessories 

Body building? Volume and shorter rest in rhe 8-12 rep range lots of tempo.

Basically there is no ""best program"" establish a goal, pick one that fits that goal and try to consistently do that workout. If your bored try another one.

What is the best workout routine?,"Honestly, there's no wrong answer because the best routine is the one you can do consistently but certain training splits work better for different goals. 

If you're into powerlifting you'll be running obnoxiously long training cycles in order to build strength needed for the 3 main lifts. Everything should be very deliberate and you'll need to track your progress VERY carefully.

If you're into bodybuilding it's usually all about volume (IMO). Push/pull/legs or upper/lower splits are very popular along with the tried and tested bro split. The big thing though is that you really need to hit every muscle group at least twice a week.

If you're new to the gym and you want to build strength I've always recommended 5x5 or Starting Strength splits. Very easy to follow and even the shittiest gyms will have what you need.

If you aren't into lifting weights at all (Even though you really should), cardio is fine but try to make it challenging. HIIT or yoga work wonders along with normal steady state cardio.",1,0,198,198,,198,ElSalvo,AggresiveKoala40,0

My grandpa was very strong solely just from working when he was young.), but if you're just trying to get moderately fit, then this works.

what is your opinion on ducks?,"I have a very sad story related to ducks:

When I was nine my elementary school science class was learning about animal conception and egg fertilization. We had this part where we put duck eggs in an incubator and waited till they hatched. When they eventually hatched, the school allowed students to take home up to two ducks as pets. 

My family volunteered to take two ducks home, and we loved them as pets for months. For the first few weeks, we let them stay inside the house. My mother complained about the duck feces and the smell, so we put them outside in a plastic play-set house. For the first couple of days, they were comfortable. Our backyard was fenced, so we didn’t worry about them escaping (they also couldn’t fly yet).

One day we woke up, and the ducks weren’t there. My parents had told me that they flew away, as they had reached the average age in a duck’s life where they begin to fly. I believed the story for seven years up until a couple of falls ago. Me and my family were at a pumpkin patch (was part of a farm) and they had ducks. My father then remembered our old pet ducks, and he told us that we were older now, and that we deserved to know the truth.

It turns out that on the morning we woke and didn’t find them, my father had woken up early and went outside to give the ducks food and water. He told us that he couldn’t find them, but that there was a trail of yellow feathers leading down a hill and behind a tree in our backyard.

My father followed the trail and was saddened by what he had found. One of our ducklings was found dead, with a large, brutal bite/wound on its neck. Our father told us that he never found our other duckling, and that it could theoretically have lived and escaped.

When our mother hears the news that day, she was devastated (she has extremely strong maternal instincts). She had known for all of the seven years, and explained what she wanted to do. She was going to buy new ducks that day just so we wouldn’t find out, but my father insisted that they should just lie and tell us that the ducks flew away.

Me and my siblings were saddened by this, but we never told our younger brother the truth. He was still incredibly little when the rest of us had found out. We still haven’t told him the truth to this day.

We have good memories of our old pet ducks, their names were Quacklin and Waddles.",1,0,88,88,,88,SirPizzaroni,Gamingshadow77,0

Ducks are known for Anatidae characterized by broad, flat bills and specialized webbed feet for swimming. They look very adorable and endearing.

In addition to being cute and entertaining, ducks play important ecological roles, such as helping to control insect populations, spreading seeds, and serving as a food source for predators.  
  
Humans have also interacted with ducks for thousands of years, both as a source of food and as pets. Domesticated ducks are commonly raised for their meat, eggs, and down feathers, and they are also popular in park ponds and as household pets.

As long as your address stays the same even if your district lines change the city or town can change that for you.  But they need to know that it's truly you and if you move your new town can easily add you in.

The two cons I can come up with… on an economic scale, sending ballots and mailers and things to people not registered to vote or actively avoiding the vote seems like a waste of money, fuel, etc. Certainly a weak argument against automatic registration. 

Also, automatic registration may breed people who just don’t want to and it’s no longer a bit taboo to be registered and not vote. It may actually decrease those who do take advantage.

"American Redditors, what would the advantages and disadvantages be of automatic voter registration upon turning 18?

Nor does it mean automatic registration renewal upon changing addresses (USPS makes this easy if you register your Change-Of-Address, but there is a not-insignificant percentage of people who don't do this (which I cannot find, but from misdelivery stats it's maybe in the 1--5% area -- the correction is eventually made automatically)). Nor does it mean that you will have all your paperwork with you when you need to verify your identity/registration according to each states' laws. If that verification involves a multi-purpose voter ID or other state ID, then it also does not mean that the person wants to spend their time -- sometimes several hours of a full workday -- in a longer verification or certification process at an overworked understaffed and inconvenient government office (typically DMV) to obtain the ID.

In short, among proposals to improve the voting system in America, automatic verification would be next to useless by itself and would instead be a part of a larger reform strategy. In any case, there would be some existing data and review study regarding the effectiveness of any one set of solutions already, that should help inform future policy decisions (note the results one version of implementation in one area at one time should substantially inform, but not dictate, policy.)",1,0,175,175,,175,kompootor,Secsidar,0

Taking risks and having more fun. I was a stick in the mud, didn't date or travel much, and stayed with a job I hated for too long because it was one of the few stable sources of employment in my hometown.

* I wish I overcame my depression sooner. I wish I had people that could see my situation and try to help me, I wish that I learned better life skills sooner. It took me to my mid 20s to start making noticeable progress on this.

--

* I regret hanging on to bad jobs for as long as I did. I worked with a series of bad people, at bad jobs with bad bosses and colleagues, and I put too much effort into them. It damaged me physically, emotionally and mentally, and I haven't really fully recovered yet, and in the end it didn't make me any richer. And it really didn't matter much in the grand scheme of things. I made a lot more money in the past two years than in the previous 8. I should have had other priorities.

--

* I regret not moving out sooner. It's not something I could control, since I lacked the money to make it so, but my parents, while good people at heart, have been horrible for my mental health since I was a child growing up. The lacked and never really learned proper parental skills, or good life skills for that matter. There is daily substance abuse, arguing, bad behaviours, sometimes even violence, and many other problems which I had to deal with since birth, and have left me with likely permanent emotional scars and a lot of trauma to process. I find that interacting with them in smaller doses is much better for me. And having to take care of my own needs without unwanted ""help"" is great for my confidence and life skills.

--

* Because of the previous problems I also feel ""left behind"" in many aspects of life. Instead of the easy confidence of a man my age, I'm anxious about even simple stuff, like booking an appointment or eating out alone at a high-end restaurant.

--

* Since I also avoided relationships and intimacy due to my many problems, I'm far behind on that as well, and feel it's getting harder to get into the more time passes. I don't feel the need for closeness with another person often. But when I do, I'm extra hard on myself because I can't justify my own value to myself enough to have the confidence to pursue my current romantic interest. Even when the other person reciprocates my feelings, I end up sabotaging myself thinking I'm doing them a favor by turning them down, it's not a healthy mindset to have. I hope I'll be able to see a therapist about this and my other issues sometimes soon.

I also never got my drivers license for reasons related to anxiety and being heavily chastised for failing it the first time I tried. People underestimate the access that having a personal car gives you. It's not just about driving to work, but it opens the door to trying out many activities you wouldn't attempt before, like spontaneously going fishing, or taking a long road-trip with a friend, or doing any activity that requires some travel and transportation.

---

All in all, I'm not being too hard on myself. Sure, things could have been a lot better, but I didn't have the skills, knowledge or environment to make that happen. I'm rather proud of where I am now, even if comparatively I'm somewhat behind where a ""normal"" person would be at this time in their life. It's like everybody was climbing Everest while I climbed out of the Mariana Trench and just reached sea level, from a glance it's unimpressive, maybe even pathetic, but that's without knowing the depths which I had to crawl out off.

I swore off relationships with women behind friendship, and worked on myself. Did a lot of ‘me’ searching, made weekend trips with my dog, did the things *I* wanted to, and just focused on myself. I grew exponentially as a person, abs I came out so much better for it. I ended up letting go of a lot of anger, too, which in itself was uplifting.

Only sad part of it is that my old travelling pupper crossed the rainbow bridge last year. Best dog ever, and I miss her to this day",1,0,116,116,,116,k0uch,i__love__myself,0

"What is a videogame with the deepest, most intense lore?","The JRPG series ""The Legend of Heroes"" from a small Japanese developer called Nihon Falcom 

It's a long running series of games, all connected to each other. It spans years, multiple countries and a cast of characters that eventually all meet up near one of the latest entries (think Avengers)

There's 12 games right now with more coming.

For anyone interested, the first trilogy is on Steam. It's called: Trails in the Sky.

It's turned based (like final fantasy) and the music is absolutely FANTASTIC.

Here's the wiki entry for the series: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trails_(series)

Three seemingly unrelated games all happening in the same (at the time) universe.  QB got retconned out due to rights issues, but you'd never know it.  It still stands as a piece of the whole, and it's all weird and beautiful.

The story that Remedy is telling is so big and fun and grand, a little scary, a lot exhilarating, multi-faceted, and full of rewarding surprises.  

Imagine three different episodes of the Twilight Zone, but each is feature length, and they're all woven together and intersect in ways you couldn't have expected.  That's the remedyverse, and were it not for Stephen King's Dark Tower, or most of Clive Barker's output, were it not for Sandman or Dune, or Allen Moore's Swamp Thing (in other words were it not for singularly fantastic classic examples of fantasy writing) this would be my favorite story.",11,0,671,671,,671,sentient_luggage,DreadQuiet,0

Ankama literally made a whole universe with a slew of gods with 12 distinct and pretty unique ones making up the major pantheon. Also they have plenty of lesser gods (which I don't think they ever really talk about outside of referencing they exist as far as I can recall), according to some lore text about the Goddess Pandawa. They even made a whole entire Hell like place where you can find demon monster creatures that can be bound to objects and end up taking control of the weak-minded.

Their world, the World of Twelve, also has its own history that makes it feel like an actual world rather than just a stage for a series to take place, while feeling pretty unique compared to other medieval worlds in other MMORPGs like RuneScape.",1,0,671,671,,671,Fuzz_Lord,DreadQuiet,0

There is no statement, save this one, that applies to everything. You have to take everything as it comes and try to do the most you can for yourself and for others. And you have to have the wisdom to know that sometimes the short term suffers for an amazing long term benifit. Equally important is the wisdom to know that the long term benefit isn't worth destroying yourself in the short term. What is important is that you self reflect and be concious of the consequences of your choices.

Are you a bad person or a good person in your own mind? Why?,"I’m gonna try to explain my thoughts without sounding like a pseudo intellectual. I don’t think I’m good or bad. I’ve done bad things without intending to, hurting people just out of circumstance in trying to do something I enjoy. I’ve also done good things unintentionally. I’ve done both intentionally as well. Now, you can go on and take one of a few paths like “the goodness in an individual is determined based on what’s on the inside, not the actions of a person” and have that sort of… I don’t know, like even the worst person can be redeemed sort of mindset. Or you could take a more practical approach and say “it doesn’t matter what they think or feel, they did these bad things and are therefore a bad person”. Or, and this is my personal philosophy, I believe that we all have the potential to do wonderful, beautiful things. I also believe that we all have the potential to do horrendous, reprehensible things. All it takes is a nudge in one direction or the other. And no amount of me judging somebody is going to change their deeds or make them as human beings change. So why would I judge myself like that? I have done many things in my past which I regret.

Are you a bad person or a good person in your own mind? Why?,"Bad. I think to be a ""good person"" is a fiction people tell themselves without the desire to inspect their lasting consequences on the world around them.

Downstream unintended consequences that are known but ignored in favor of short term benefits are a bad choice.

Almost all of human nature and society depends on bad decisions, bad actions, killing of other animals and plants for survival. If we had to stare down the equvilant of what we eat over our life, in some magical way, where you come face to face with the many animals, people, and plants we need to die for us to survive.... face that and say ""clearly I'm more important than all that"". Thats bad.

Life is bad. 

Maybe the wolf looks dope on a t-shirt, and its puppies look up to it and love mom.... but to the infant elk found and eaten alive... wolves suck ass. Bad 

Plants, sure its hard to anthropomorphic them.... but they communicate and such, all life's related. Doubt they be chill with the elk eating them, as much as the cow we gonna kill and eat.

The dirt below us is filled with the excrement of 4 billion years of bad life chewing itself up, macro to micro. 

We live on a hell world, with extra layers of bad untop of bad, so convoluted we dream that there is a good here.",1,0,218,218,,218,Stinsudamus,TooYoungToBeThisOld1,0

Ability wise I'm hindered by my brain (adhd), if I'm in the ideal timeline the processes I'm working on in therapy to bypass this flawed wiring will work but right now I'm definitely not reaching my potential.

In D&D alignment chart terms I think of myself as chaotic good.

> A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of him. He makes his own way, but he’s kind and benevolent. He believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations. He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do. He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society.

But I deeply believe that everyone has a price where the personal incentive is high enough to do “bad” things.

I judge people who’s price is low or who misjudged their personal incentives to a degree that they ended up unhappy while also being shitty to those around them.

It takes a lot of willpower to not go ape shit on whoever or whatever caused harm to myself or the other person. 

I've been told in the past that I lack empathy (which I've seen is true, and have a good idea as to what that source is), so I've worked for years trying to remedy that.

I want people to see me as overall good, but I need people to know I’m bad. 
My internal dialogue…Uhm she isn’t a good person. Knowing no one will ever hear my thoughts makes my thoughts dark. But that’s everyone right?
It is important for me to think my family see me as good. 
I have often been surprised how I can have a strong positive relationship with someone. Where I truly have a persons trust and respect. Mutually we show each other love and support and then I just sabotage. I don’t know why. It repeats time and time. Work colleagues, friends, lovers. I am just cold. Often mean. Perhaps I do something calculated. I’ve had affairs with married men and outted them to theirs wives. I’ve encouraged people I work with to share too much on social media and highlighted their unprofessional public opinions to HR. I’ve told mistruths to friends about other friends. I just don’t care. I see the destruction, pain and chaos and I turn my back and get on with myself and I. 
I pick litter of ground, i drop loose change into charity buckets. I look after my friends & family’s children & pets with nothing expected in return. I spend money on my less financially secure friend. I treat her time and time again and never expect the gesture returned. 
I accepted my husband sleeping with other people before I even thought about doing it my self. I run around after him, cook all his meals. Support him, massage him, be available for sex. Enable his fantasies and fetishes to play out.

Whether you'd feel happy or sad initially, you'd be massively fucked psychologically if you actually remembered this dream. Just about every memory you may have of high school, college and life as an adult would be wrong. Your first high school girlfriend who cheated on you? She might not be interested in you in the first place to date you, or she might be a perfectly lovely person that would never cheat. Your friends you made in college or after? Imaginary friends. Your career? The day to day work is totally different.

Hell, ""objective facts"" you learned would be wrong. Calculus? You made up how that functioned entirely. The crucible? It's totally different. German is not spoken like that. Testicular torsion does not feel like that. That chick from Wednesday is not ""attractive but you can't put your finger on why."" She's made up. There's no such country as ""Tunisia."" Yeah, disrespecting that group of people is actually acceptable by the standards of the time. Blowjobs feel totally different. No, couscous doesn't taste like that. That's not how ""keenwa"" is spelled. You cannot, in fact, do a backflip. ""Chicanery"" is a made up word. Putting ""that"" in your asshole, will kill you. The  Marvel Cinematic Universe ain't that huge. Dinosaurs don't have feathers. Brad Pitt's a sweet guy. ""Tick Tock"" is a Kesha song. People are still pretty chill about Columbus day. Juneteenth was made up in your brain. The Orange Man is not a politically viable candidate. There is no such thing as the ""K"" word. Avatar 2 will not occur. En Passant ain't something you can Google. Super Smash Bros will never feature Sora. Pussy smells different. It's spelled, ""Berenstein Bears."" Coronavirus never happened; if someone's wearing a mask like that, they're scorpion from mortal Kombat. 2012 is the end of the world. You made love with a man dressed like Shrek. Babies are much larger than you thought. That woman you dreamt to be your wife actually looks weirdly like a cross between your brother and your aunt. There is a war in Ba Sing Se. You were somehow correct about the taste of cum, but no one uses that word. Bitcoin sounded made up because it was made up. ""Eating ass"" is not a real thing. There's no such thing as high speed internet. Osama Bin Laden was a freedom fighter. Bill Cosby is dope. You just made up the song ""Gangnam Style"" and none of the words you made up were actually Korean. You were, somehow, correct about the way that cum tastes after someone has eaten pineapple. Emojis don't exist. The emoji movie does, somehow exist. 

Plenty of people are saying they'd stay away from drugs and alcohol. Your brain just made up how those things affect you.",174,0,8759,8759,,8759,BackAlleySurgeon,HM333XOXO,0

Would I be any wiser, after all?

How would it be a 52 years old hopeless loser in a 14 years old body?

Having current mind and the outlook of that time, finding a girl friend should be very easy, but having any relationship with adults, friends or so, super difficult.

School was easy back then. With this mind and knowledge, I'd know quite a lot more about anything than my teachers back then. Most probably I'd just say that give me those tests, I'll pass them right away.

I'd be a PhD at 19?

How about the people around me? Yesterday I was mainly an ordinary teenager. Would they accept me being very different than 10 hours ago?

What would my mother think if I said that attack me once more, and you definitely will face the police?

Would anybody believe me if I said that the Soviet Union and the eastern block will collapse in just a few years?

Would they believe that the economy of my home country will stall in 1991/92 and unomployment rate will officially reach 20 % or higher and that share is probably an optimistic interpretation?

I'd say they would close me in an asylum. I suppose, that would be only place where I could feel safe.",208,0,8759,8759,,8759,Suomasema,HM333XOXO,0

Start by keeping an eye on upcoming sporting events/championships -- as a way to confirm whether the same events are playing out or not.

If so, continue along in high school as before.  Maybe be a little more confident in interpersonal relationships, but generally the same outcomes.  The biggest change would be not going to post-secondary.

Once I turned 18, I would open an invest account and purchase $500 of Apple shares.  Closing price of AAPL at the end of '98 was $0.31.  With the share splits in 2000, 2005, 2014 and 2020, each one of those shares would turn into 112 shares today.

- tell my doctor to test me for APS(a blood clotting disorder I found out I had later in life)
-make sure to go to college straight out of high school instead of taking a break year.

What is the worst relationship advice you've ever heard?,"A girl who had been a long time friend used to - from my perspective, at least - find reasons to kiss me when groups of us were hanging out and drinking or high. Happened on multiple occasions. She was an excellent kisser and said I was also. Each time was pretty damn electric. Plus, she was not only hot AF, but cool as hell. 

She ended up moving to Cali, and about a year later, I ended up moving there as well, although a different city about 90 minutes away. Once I got there, I looked her up and got in touch with her, and drove to go hang out with her and her sister. 

This happened several times, and I realized that - without any other distractions such as a GF on my part - I was actually really, really into her, and I thought I felt the same in return from her. It just really felt like there was major chemistry between us, beyond just being good friends. Nothing more has happened physically up to that point. I wasn’t overly concerned about that, and thought that she was just kind of taking her time this time (she had always been the initiator of any physical contact between us, so I figured I’d just let her do that when she was ready). However, I made the mistake of saying something to my dad about the situation. He was/is the type of guy who believes that all women secretly want a strong type who will take charge and take control. In my head, it didn’t seem quite right from what I knew of her, but he convinced me that I should quit playing around and next time we are together just make my own move. 

It actually took a couple more times of getting together, but finally, I felt like I was going to go for it. We were sitting on a couch, and she leaned toward me and was kind of hugging/holding me anyway, so I leaned in and went for a kiss (pretty sure there is never a time that looks cool if the other party doesn’t reciprocate). She immediately pushed away. I don’t remember exactly what she said, but the gist was that I had obviously gone farther than she ever expected us to. 

I apologized, of course, but it was naturally awkward the rest of the time until she went to bed and I fell asleep on the couch.

The next morning I came out of the bathroom and heard her talking to her sister about “they never respect boundaries”. I was already embarrassed, but now I felt terrible about how could I have read that so wrong. It wasn’t just making the move the night before, either. All the sudden, I had that sinking feeling in my stomach that everything I had interpreted up to that point had been all wrong somehow. I got pissed - mostly at myself, but a little at her because it felt like she had manipulated me somewhat - and walked out into the living room, said I was really sorry again and left. 

It was a couple weeks before we talked again, but eventually we started hanging out like before. While the strong friendship was still there, it was definitely different. Over the next year or so, I would continue to drop hints about being good friends with someone you were dating, but she wouldn’t react. I got to the point that I was very frustrated because I still felt like there could be something more, but she clearly didn’t feel the same and I just couldn’t understand why. I ended up telling her basically that in an email, and we didn’t talk again for several months until I called her and said I was moving away and would like to hang out one last time.
Looking back, I still don’t understand how I got it all so wrong. I accept that I may have just been infatuated (and horny) and so was reading things the way I wanted them to be, but it has always seemed to me like she definitely teased me for many years leading up to that just because she knew she could. Then, when it got too personal and intimate between just the two of us, she got scared. Hell! I’m probably still wrong about the whole situation. 

Anyway, she was a really cool person, and I missed her friendship if nothing else, and always felt bad for my part in making it all weird.

What is the worst relationship advice you've ever heard?,"I'm a guy, married happily for 32 years to my wife. We are equals in our relationship in everything.

I'm a lifelong resident of the South. If I attend one more wedding where a fundamentalist preacher gets up and tells the bride that she needs to submit to her husband in my marriage, I'll likely stand up in the pew and yell, ""Don't listen to that asshole!"" That misinterpretation of scripture has led to more unhappy marriages than anything.

My long-time assistant, a lovely woman in every sense of the word, was in one of those (She died several years ago after a long struggle with cancer). One day, while driving several hours to a client meeting, she and I were talking when suddenly she piped up.

""So, in your marriage, who is responsible for the money?""

I tried to make a joke of it.

""Well, my wife is a CPA, has her degree in finance, and is the CFO of a mid-sized and well-run company. My degree is in English and I think a cash register means I'm supposed to give you all my money.""

""No, really.""

""My wife handles the money.""

""Oh, that would never fly in our marriage. We're in a husband-led marriage and Keith makes all the decisions.""

Mind you, I had a really good professional friendship with this woman, but I never wanted to cross the line into talking about her marriage. But she kind of vented at how helpless she felt because she knew nothing about their financial situation. She got an allowance and that was that.

Yet I know any number of families that operate that way, basically reducing the women down to the glorified hired help.

What is the worst relationship advice you've ever heard?,"I was 19 and an older coworker knew I was having trouble staying in relationships at the time. 

Now for some context, I was a mess at this age and once I got into relationships the girls I dated realized I wasn't worth their time and oh boy were they right. They were good people and I look back on them positively because I learned from them. I was never abusive or even mean, I was just going down a bad road and they saw I was nothing but trouble for them so that's why I couldn't hang on to the relationships.

So this coworker showed me a line on the sidewalk and said ""Imagine this as your girlfriend's day and the line is content mood. To the right we have happiness and on the left we have sadness. First thing in the morning you need to put her down."" He then moved to the left of the line. ""You need to keep her here until around 2pm."" He moved forward and said ""Once 2pm hits you need to compliment her, start bringing her to the content line and get there by dinner. After dinner you need to really start building her up and making her feel good."" He then proceeded to walk to the right of the line. 

He said ""She'll go to sleep happy thinking of how great you are but won't have the confidence to ever leave you if you use my method.""

Again, at 19 I was a mess and making terrible choices but this had me mortified. Even then 16 years ago at my dumbest state I knew this was extremely abusive. I don't associate with him these days and I know for a fact he's a miserable loser through a few mutual friends. The gf he had at the time of this advice cheated on him and stole a bunch of his belongings before she dipped.

What is the worst relationship advice you've ever heard?,"The single most hated piece of advice: Relationships take work.

No.  No they don't.  Bad relationships are an absolute struggle, and they suck.  People will try to make garbage work simply because they think being alone is worse.

Yes, relationships do require sacrifice of self to invest into the partnership.  It's compromise of self for betterment of the collective.  But, this isn't work.  It isn't hard to do.  All it takes is acceptance of the idea.

If you HAVE to put work into the relationship, it's a bad relationship.  Stop, leave, find someone better.  Stop wasting time making a bad thing barely function.  Want to know what it leads to?  Divorce.  You'll probably have kids too, so that'll be fun.  

I've had the joy of watching a friend struggle through this scenario.  After nearly a decade together and 2 kids, want to know when he knew it wasn't going to work out and that he should have left?  Year 1.  He knew fully back then.  But, he tried.  He tried to make it work.  He tried to fix it.  Maybe marriage would magically fix everything.  Maybe kids are the answer.  Maybe more gifts.  Maybe more sex.  Maybe, maybe, maybe, some small actions, some grand.  In the end, not one changed the reality.  It was doomed from the start and he knew it.  But he tried.  He worked at it.

I've also seen friends who hate themselves sticking in a relationship that's toxic for them, just for the sake of being in a relationship, any relationship.  They bound over every hurdle to make it work, and they're miserable every second.  They don't even want to do it.  But they have to.  They've already performed the mental gymnastics to justify the ""value"" of staying in it, and they decided suffering was an ok trade off.  Great, so you just built a relationship on masochism.  Cool.  Totally worth it.

Relationships, really good relationships are effortless.  And yes, you will have to become a different person than your alone self to be in that partnership.  But, it's not work.  It's not effort.  It's not a struggle.  You actually enjoy it.  You want it.  You are happy in it.",0,0,156,156,,156,mvw2,Spectrelegit,0
What is the biggest unsolved mystery in human history?,"In 1893, British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans purchased some ancient stones with mysterious inscriptions on them at a flea market in Athens. On a later trip to the excavations at Knossos on the island of Crete, he recognized one of the symbols from his stones and began a study of the engraved tablets being uncovered at various sites on the island. He discovered two different systems, which he called Linear A and Linear B. While Linear B was deciphered in the early 1950s (it turned out to represent an early form of Greek), Linear A, above, has still not been deciphered.

What is the biggest unsolved mystery in human history?,"Late to the party but I haven’t seen anyone mention the Indus Valley script. There was a huge civilization in northern India and Pakistan around 3300-1300 BC. It spanned more area than any other civilization at the time. They invented writing independently, something only done 5-6 times in history. But to this day, with all the thousands of inscriptions we have and all the documented contact with other civilizations, we haven’t deciphered their writing. There’s no known Rosetta Stone, no known descendant scripts, no known documentation of the language other than what is written in the Indus Valley script. 

But the biggest mystery isn’t how to read the script or what it says, but the question of whether we’ll ever be able to know. Is it even possible to decipher a language we know absolutely nothing about?

Edit: to all the people talking about AI, yes. I get it. AI is cool, but this is a far larger task than the pattern recognizing and replicating AI we have today can tackle on its own.

What is the biggest unsolved mystery in human history?,"Between 1200 and 1150 BCE, most of the civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean region were either greatly depleted or collapsed entirely, bringing an abrupt end to the Bronze Age. These civilizations were massively depopulated, their palaces and cities were destroyed or abandoned, and some transformed into small, isolated village cultures or nomadic herders. The Greek Linear B script was lost, and there is no written record of the following period of Greek history, meaning that Greeks of the time were probably illiterate.

This rapid decline affected - to one extent or another - major historical powers like Mycenaean Greece, New Kingdom Egypt, the Hittite Empire, and Assyria, among others.

*And we don't know why it happened*.

These were sprawling, thriving civilizations, with healthy economies, elaborate trade networks, complex bureaucracy, written language, and large-scale agriculture, and they just...died.

She was killed in the early morning at a church that she taught yoga at. Security footage from the church showed the murderer roaming the halls of the church all night but that’s not what’s weird. What’s weird is that the murderer was dressed head to toe in police riot gear. It is the weirdest and eeriest video footage and is just unsettling. There’s lots of theories but her murder has never been solved and I believe there hasn’t even been a real suspect in the case.,2387,0,14210,14210,,14210,PaxtonRose,InsertBurnsHere,0

 All known records of the city's early history date from the 5th or 6th century BC at the earliest (which doesn’t help the usual foundation date of 753 BC) and all of the foundation myths are exactly that, stories. All we know with any certainty is that Rome was ruled by kings at some point in its early history. But we don’t know who founded Rome; if it really was by a Romulus type figure or if it was multiple villages that eventually merged into a single town. Even with the latter possibility, it’s unknown when those communities would have considered themselves as a single town or when they decided to call it ‘Rome’.",632,0,14210,14210,,14210,Final_Walrus_9416,InsertBurnsHere,0
What is the biggest unsolved mystery in human history?,"So I have a personal experience, sort of. My father had a coworker who was a great guy. Good at his work, fun to talk to, nobody had any complaints about him. He lived in an apartment right next to work so the night watchman at the workplace would see him whenever he went out.

So one night, he went out in his pajamas, talking on his cell phone, nodded at the watchman. The watchman didn't think much of it, after all, it's not all that weird to take a walk even though it was quite late. He didn't think much of it. The watchman didn't see him come back, but he figured he missed him when he went on his bathroom break probably.

But the guy didn't show up at work the next day. Someone from work went to check up and he wasn't there. Nothing was disturbed, he was just gone. Everyone thought he had dropped dead - killed by thugs or an accident or some medical condition. The workplace filed a police report. Here's when it gets weird. It turns out, the guy had created a fake identity. Any credentials he had given were fake. The references he had given had never heard of him. The family address he'd given didn't exist. The police didn't find anything illegal in the apartment, but they didn't find anything that would give a clue as to who he was either.

We moved away a few years ago, but I don't think the case was ever solved. It's definitely the best unexplained mystery that I've personally come across.

Edit: To answer some questions, I don't live in the US and there's no concept of witness protection here that I know of. My father was a pathologist at a women's hospital in a very small town and the guy worked as his technician. He definitely had some experience in the field before he joined.

What is the biggest unsolved mystery in human history?,"The Alps Murders. 

To this day not only is there no suspect but seemingly absolutely no motive to the murders of the Al-Hilli family and a completely unrelated French cyclist. The police don’t even know who the target was. The more you look at the case, the more questions there are. The victims were killed in the manner of a professional hit, but using a gun that no professional would use. The gunman was experienced and calm enough to leave the scene quickly and efficiently, so much so that the cyclist on the scene minutes behind Mollier saw and heard absolutely nothing. The murders though were uncontrolled and carried out in broad daylight where anybody could have chanced upon the scene. Indeed had Saad not beached his car trying to escape, most of the victims may have survived. 

No suspect. No motive. No clear target. Weird mix of professional hit and complete novice. This case baffles me utterly. I dearly hope to see it solved one day.",1426,0,14210,14210,,14210,Fraggle_Frock,InsertBurnsHere,0

We have an incredibly little perception of our world and everything that surrounds us as we try to understand everything, just like the first humans finding fire, yet the biggest mistery in all of human history that will continue to drown us, is no other than ourselves. The brain is one of the most impressive creations of nature, however it always keeps contradicting itself, we thought the brain's objective was to survive but also many people every year end up losing the fight against their own brains, we know little about how does mental conditions like Dementia, Psychosis in all of its forms, Autism, Personality Disorders and Phobias really come from. 

Existence and conscience are probably the most mysterious out of these, we don't understand how does conscience really works and thus reality, the human eye for example allows us to see bits of light in things and we know for a fact there are objects that change once they are being viewed, but does ANYTHING really exist if there is nobody there to see it or feel it? 

And finally there is death, one of the most important law in chemistry is that ""matter cannot be created or destroyed, just changed"" -Lavoisier i think. Our conscience certainly is a kind of matter since it occupies a space in the universe, however what happens after death is completely unknown, Matter isn't destroyed so there is no way that our conscience, memories and thoughts can just disappear once they are part of something in the universe but then, ¿Where do they go once we die?

Our school warned us that there was a filter that checked for offensive language and we would be punished for using it, okay fair enough makes sense.

One day I and about 5 other kids get dragged out of class and were to get detention for writing profanity.

I was confused and worried and shocked, ""What did I write?!? I've never used swear words or anything!""

So the other kids wrote things like fuck, shit, piss, fuck your mother, things of that nature.

I wrote ""fart."" What the fuck?

I said to the teacher ""Am I seriously going to be punished for writing 'fart'?""

""You shouldn't be writing any offensive language!!! Yes you get detention!""

I am still mad whenever this pops into my head but I am actually kind of grateful, I got a lesson early in life about how full of shit authority is and how people in positions of authority are not owed anymore respect than the authority they have to affect my life.

What's the most unfair punishment you've gotten in school?,"In 5th grade I had 2 teachers: one for normal stuff (called H) and one for an accelerated math class that worked 1 year ahead (called S). Both were awful

The math one had my oldest sister a few years prior and hated my sister. One day in February S was explaining something and thought I wasn't paying attention. So she said my name. Then, because she thought I was paying attention, she sent me into the hallway for the last 15 minutes of class, with very aggressive voice. I didn't say anything because I kinda froze in fear. Was I actually not paying attention? By the end of this you'll realize that this question is irrelevant. After class, S walks me back to my normal class to talk to H. She says, and I quote, ""I do not want him in my class anymore."" And guess what? The next day I was stuck in H's class during math. But H wasn't an accelerated math teacher, so I was ""learning"" stuff I had learned the previous year. Mind you, there was another accelerated math teacher for 5th grade (who was previously my 3rd grade teacher and she was amazing). Anyway, the incident happened on a Thursday, so I was in a different class on the Friday. Thursday afternoon, S sent an email to my mom that my mom described as ""incendiary"" and told me I couldn't read it until I was older. So it must've been pretty bad. I still don't know what it said and I'm in my 20s 

My parents are understandably pissed. They knew S hated my oldest sister, and that hate carried over to me. My mom suspects that S was xenophobic, in a very ""blond hair and blue eyes"" way (we're not white, by the way). My mom demanded a meeting between my parents and S, and the meeting was set for the following Tuesday when everyone went to Art class. However, on the Monday, I was called outside into the hallway to talk to... the principal. I was scared, but in what has to be a first the principal took my side in this and agreed that the punishment was beyond reasonable. I didn't even have to say anything, he just called me out to reassure me that I was in the right. How did this happen? 

Well, my mom had apparently forwarded the incendiary email to the principal with a brief explanation of the situation. This was enough to convince him that what S did was out of line. So shoutout to the principal for being a G and taking the student's side over a teacher 

Anyway, now for the Tuesday meeting during Art class. My dad was out of town so he had to call in, but my mom came in to meet with S and H. The meeting went... poorly. All of a sudden S was saying that I was going to stay in her class, while my dad kept saying he wanted me out and in the other accelerated math class (which I wouldn't have complained about). H was trying to take S' side and say that the punishment on Friday was reasonable and that S was level-headed and stuff. My mom, because she's smart like that, had printed out the incendiary email and slid it across the table so H could read it. Clearly, H never saw this and the color drained from H's face as she realized she couldn't defend S anymore. Meanwhile, my dad and S were still arguing over my placement. I hadn't said a word the entire time and it was clear that I had nothing to contribute, so I asked if I could go to Art. They all agreed to let me go, so I never saw how that meeting resolved

What's the most unfair punishment you've gotten in school?,"From 2nd grade until the end of 8th grade, I was constantly removed from classes, isolated, and given some kind of task to perform under threat of physical abuse in school.. Elementary school principal punishments were... Creative to say the least... 1 was he would write something on a block of wood and then I had to sand the wood with very very fine grain sand paper until you could no longer see the ink.. Another would be directly copying text from encyclopedias.. And a third would be writing numbers with a comma between them from 1 until... Whenever it was time to stop... The reason they kind of had to threaten me physically is because if it felt unjustified I would refuse... And if they just made me sit somewhere I would get bored and eventually fall asleep... I last 2 years of elementary school I didn't even have a class, I just went to the principals office... Ate lunch with the principal..

That was at school... Home was a different ball game and might explain why punishing me at school did no good... My father and step mother would routinely sit me at the kitchen table and demand explanations for my behavior at home.. Think tv police interrogation except there's no good cop... Hours at a time... Eventually I just said I don't know why I did stuff because anything I said was wrong or 'not a reason, an excuse' punishments varied from weeks or months being grounded, excessively long periods where I was the only one in the house with any chores(4 siblings)... So I was taking care of the family dogs(4) and basically cleaning up after everyone.. Had to clean both bathrooms(1 1/2 baths) vacuum the whole house(until they tore out the carpet to use the hardwood floors then came moping and waxing) dishes after each meal, cleaning up the dog excrement from the yard, making sure the dogs went outside to potty... And if my 'work wasn't good enough' I would end up with that task assigned for a week or two longer... By not good enough I mean there was a single hair in view in the bathroom, completely restart and time added.. Kitchen 1 crumb wedged against a base board time added, 1 drop of water inside the sink still, time added...

The most petty, I was grounded for 2 weeks for grunting in response to 'good morning' after being awake and out of bed for less than a minute...

The harshest one, I don't even remember what I'd done wrong... I was grounded from everything... Not allowed to leave the kitchen table... No tv.. No music.. Not allowed to talk to anyone.. If I didn't have to be at school.. I had to be at the kitchen table... Limited number of times to go to the bathroom... For over a year... Only bit of comfort was being allowed to read books...

I've been grounded from Christmas presents I hadn't received yet... Same with birthday... I received gifts I never even got to touch because the only value they had for me was trading them to a sibling for something I wasn't already grounded from...

I have no idea how many times I was spanked paddled punched slapped thrown etc..

I was in trouble at school for so long because I could not see detail beyond maybe a meter.. I desperately needed glasses but my father refused to believe it... Even though he was issued glasses in the military... Repeatedly was told by teachers I needed them... I had no idea how bad my eyes were until I was 14?",1,0,37,37,,37,Capital-Ad-6206,Squirrelkid11,0

What's the most unfair punishment you've gotten in school?,"I went to a fundamentalist Christian school for third and fourth grade— literally the kinda school where it would be like, “time for science class! Break out your bibles!” 

The teacher tried to tell us the world was 6,000 years old— I was in third grade and had just seen *Jurassic Park* in the theater over the weekend. I was totally baffled— I wasn’t out to challenge the man, but I was just super confused and super curious after having such a bomb dropped on me. I asked him question after question— he told me dinosaur fossils were placed on earth by satan and that believing in them was a one-way ticket to hell. This only resulted in me asking more and more questions— he then screamed at me in front of everyone and made me stay in at recess and write, “I will obey my scripture and elders” 100 times on the board. That’s just the tip of the iceberg with this guy, too— the absolute epitome of “religious fruitcake”.",1,0,37,37,,37,GG-Allins-Balls,Squirrelkid11,0
What's the most unfair punishment you've gotten in school?,"When I was 13 I was being “picked on” by one of my classmates. 

I use quotes because it really didn’t bother me too much since I knew he didn’t have a problem with me but was unhappy with himself and was jealous to see me (a really similar person on most aspects) be happy. His sentiment wasn’t shared by anyone else. 

One day he couldn’t take it and tried provoking a fight on the play ground. He threw objects at me and eventually got up to swing at me from behind. Everyone attested to him starting it and throwing the first punch, a blind side cheap one too. They had a video I wish I saved. Anyway, it escalated and I turned around to engage. I grew up on a dairy farm and even though we were similar size, I was a good bit stronger even at age 13. I ended up breaking his nose and injured his arm and wrist and sent him to the hospital. He landed a few bruises on me but I had no major injuries. 

Well being the studious kid I went immediately to the office to sit with an admin to report and document the incident. Have a full report, didn’t lie once, including going back to the history of this kid acting out over the last few months and other adults and teachers doing nothing. I named witnesses and then even pulled the security camera footage. Everything checked out and everyone backed up what I said, this guy has been being an idiot for months including starting and escalating the fight. 

When the admin finished the report he called in my parents to deliver my verdict: I was ordered on a week of suspension and missed class, I was also to write an apology letter to every teacher whose class I missed and to this student whom I quarreled with. My parents were outraged since it was clearly not my fault and even the repot showed I was a victim of this kid and other teachers failure to act before. Well the admin said the schools no tolerance policy meant that even being involved in any way meant I was to be punished. That he was being nice and awarding the softest punishment that wouldn’t go on my record and I wouldn’t be expelled over this. My teachers were ashamed of their failure so they ended up passing me in all of my missed assignments and never asked for the letters. My parents looked at suing the school and principal but we were very poor (they both worked 2 jobs) so couldn’t afford to send me to any other school option and the free lawyer we found said that since I had no serious physical injuries I wouldn’t be seen as a serious victim. 

This other child went on for out of school suspension where he said at home playing video games. Eventually he pulled other bullshit a year or 2 later, combined with the record of this incident meant he got expelled from the district. There was home problems for him.

TLDR: I got suspended for being a victim in a fight I didn’t start because I was involved",1,0,37,37,,37,trophycloset33,Squirrelkid11,0
What's the most unfair punishment you've gotten in school?,"4th grade, no recess for 3 weeks because I and 2 other friends made mini-comics called ""Mr.Pickle"" (a pickle with a monocle, top hat, and bazooka) running around getting money, women, and destroying everything.

... Grand theft Pickle.

The substitute caught us, confiscated, and gave them to our teacher the next day and they blew it waaaaaaay out of proportion.

The principle came up saying what we did was absolutely horrible and we were in a lot of trouble. 

The teacher stood us 3 in front of the rest of the class and asked the rest of our classmates to raise their hands if they think we shouldn't:

•be apart of the end of the year class play
•take part in the end of the year field trip
•should be allowed to have recess for the next 2-3 weeks

Of course this was an unfair biased ""trial"" if you tell everyone before hand that what these students did was bad while we were outside the room at the time being talked to by the principal, of course they'd all raise their hands. 

Got out of punishment though because mom called the school and flipped out lol.

I was forced to empty all my pockets. I then had to go around to every bin in the school with the headteacher, groundskeeper(I guess that's what you would call him?) and a police officer while they opened the bins and searched through them. They said I had a knife and might have thrown it in the bin and they were going to find it. Even after nothing was found I was suspended for weeks and had trouble with the police at 11yrs old for something I absolutely had not done. The school and police completely took this lying little cunts side and even after there was no evidence they still said I must have had a knife. To make matters worse for months afterwards my head of year would constantly be trying to get my parents to take my Xbox away because he said playing Minecraft was completely inappropriate because you could kill people with swords and axes.

In early January we were following reports of a highly contagious respiratory virus. By mid-January the virus had been sequenced and we had internal discussions about whether we could come up with a drug to fight it. My team was assigned the task of designing candidates, so we did some in silico genetic analyses of published coronavirus sequences to look where to target (evolutionary conservation suggests regions of low mutation rate). Then we designed molecules and sent them to our robots to synthesize them — we had the drug candidates made in 48 hours.

Not going into it, but the drug worked well in animal models but external logistical issues downstream stymied progress, and we knew we weren’t going to catch up to Moderna, so that was that.

At least in the beginning, though, everything was clicking and it felt like a Hollywood story unfolding: a small team of scientists, super fast drug development with genetics, computers, robots…

Doctors offices were filling up in November and December of 2019 of course this is normal because its the holiday season and you know, colds and flu however this was worse than normal.

We had a Hep A outbreak in my city in November of 2019 which stemmed from an infected Taco bell worker that was somehow allowed to work while having Hep A until they were finally sent home and they had to set up vaccine clinics and medical aid in school gyms. No I am not joking about this. I try not to eat fast food or go to restaurants now since well, its a real possibility that someone cooking your food is sick.

Little did I know what was coming after that.

I personally got sick in Feb of 2020 and I still don't know if I got it or not because there was no testing. I did stay home and do my part not to spread it. But I didn't infect the 2 other people I  live with so it may have been one of my normal sinus infections or colds that I sometimes get and I recovered normally. I have allergies too so its nearly impossible for me to tell what I have when I am sick.

It took until September of 2022 for me to get it for real this time I took a test and it was covid, fortunately I had all my shots and got over it pretty fast and it was nothing more than a cold with body chills. All signs said I would get it bad because I am overweight but it was not bad at all. I didn't even have a fever but this time it infected the other 2 people I live with and we all recovered fine even though one of the people I live with is 93 years old and she actually had the fewest symptoms as she was just tired.",10,0,860,860,,860,SaraAB87,EridanusVoid,0

In March our governor decided to cancel the big annual Arnold Schwartzenegger-sponsored bodybuilding festival in Columbus. This was a *big* deal. Shit was gettin' real.

By then I was thinking about using a mask. There weren't any available, so I used a bandanna. I tried to find elastic so my mother could sew home-made masks, but all the stores were sold out. I eventually found some elastic online... I had to buy a huge roll of it. By the time I got a couple masks from Mom, you could buy them in  stores. Eventually I found an online source for N95 masks, but by then things were opening up and I wore masks mostly to visit relatives in nursing homes.

In May we had a primary election scheduled. I was a poll worker. Monday afternoon we set up our stuff. Very late Monday night the election was postponed.

We joked about it, figured that this would just blow over like all the other flu seasons.

We were hopelessly and foolishly wrong.  We should’ve seen it coming.  And then people started getting sick, and the masks came in.  The anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers came out pretty quickly.  They were usually the first to die, too.  Same for the elderly.

Every single day I saw a hearse and a funeral convoy.  When the lockdown went into effect, I practically had the roads to myself.  I had a cop on my ass all the time because there was nothing for them to do.

And every day I would be reminded how our government failed us, and how they were spinning lies and whitewashing everything.  Every single hearse I passed was another failure.  I lost count of how many hearses I passed.

While that may have been my experience for the whole thing, what I remember the most is that it was just another normal day at the beginning.  None of us could’ve known that millions would die by the end of it.

I knew customers who were here today, gone tomorrow.  These were people I worked hard to establish positive relationships with.  It was hard to lose that network I built up because I knew them.  I knew what their usual deliveries were, I could strike up conversations on slow days.  The elderly in the nursing and retirement homes loved having someone just talk with them.

Letting all my teenage students move their lessons to later in the day (5-9:00 in the evening) so they and I didn't have to wake up early made massive differences in lesson engagement and overall happiness.

By March 12th I decided to keep my son out of daycare indefinitely and would not be returning to the office anytime soon.  The next day Trump finally declared a National Emergency and my company announced mandatory telework.

I'll also never forget the quiet calm of the world as there were absolutely 0 cars on the road.  People were walking in the middle of the street to prevent crowding sidewalks.

It has been 3 years since the start of COVID.

Covid is an airborne virus which means the droplet is smaller than 5 microns and can penetrate ordinary masks, stay in the air longer, and move around. Hence, single rooms with negative pressure are needed.

Any symptomatic patients were immediately quarantined. A lot of our patients were from group homes, nursing homes, and patients with cognitive issues. So many of them tried to climb out of the bed or get out of their room.

The other local health district opened a quarantine hotel and an enormous vaccination centre. All casual and agency nurses, even those ones from other district, started working there. Apparently, the jobs there were easier and some agency nurses were paid $100/hr or more.

We ended up barely having any casual or agency nurses. Most of us ended up sick and overworked because we did so many overtime. That time, if you are sick, you can't come to work until you've proven you're Covid negative.

There were people in the community avoiding us when they see our uniforms. That's why we were encouraged to bring civilian clothes so we can change before we go home.

I've also worked with a nurse who is a conspiracy theorist. She's a casual nurse but for some reason, she volunteered to work in the Covid ward.

I stopped going to get take out in mid February and was starting to slowly stock up on non perishables. We have a celiac in the family so we really couldn’t risk not having the right food readily available. At some point the federal health minister told everyone to have two weeks of supplies on hand in case the “had” to quarantine for a long period. That was exceptionally forceful language and got my attention. At that point I actually tried to get enough food, and yes toilet paper, for two weeks. The funny thing is our family of four hadn’t been home together at the same time for years so I literally had no idea how much TP we went through. We bought a couple large packs from Walmart before everything went crazy and ended up sharing with the in-laws who were blissfully in denial about it all until after we were all told to stay home.

Once mid March hit everything was dystopian. We wandered through Costco on the 15th and it was stripped bare. Our dog ended up with a skin infection that weekend and the vet gave us tons of antibiotics just in case they got shut down. While we were leaving there was a couple in the parking lot packing up their camper obviously fleeing. The following Monday my classes all went virtual and that was it. 

In hindsight, I’m pretty sure it was spreading among my classmates and the school I had my practicum at. One classmate tested negative for flu and his doctor was baffled by his bizarre lung infection. At one point well over half the teachers were out sick with “chest colds” but the kids were fine.

What's the best advice you can give anyone?,"“Don’t worry about controlling your emotions. Control your actions.”

This was from my geometry instructor when I was a sophomore in high school. He was the kind of guy who spent 80% of class time discussing mathematics, and 20% talking about life. He was an excellent teacher, and one hell of a human being.

The goal, I think, of parents in the area where I grew up was a kind of steely-eyed stoicism. Conceal your anger, ignore your lust, show no fear, show no weakness, be strong, strong, strong. Being awash in hormones, I could do none of those things, and I was beating myself up constantly. I think most kids in school were under the same pressure.

His advice hit me right between the eyes. The experience of emotions is outside our control, but our response to them is not. Don’t be ashamed of a feeling, but be ashamed if you act like an ass because of the feeling. That idea changed everything for me. I passed his insight on to my kids, and I still apply it to my own life decades later.

Thanks, Coach, wherever you are.

What are your personal recommendations for dealing with a 10 hour flight?,"Im guessing this is an international flight. If you can afford it:

1.	Book a seat in the main cabin. 
2.	As soon as check in online is available, do so. 
3.	During check in, upgrade to business class, or at least upgrade to the next best cabin (Comfort Plus for example on delta)

I fly back and forth from Asia all the time. I’ll never pay the ridiculous price of 5k+ for a business class seat (the main cabin prices are already fucking insane) but usually upgrading is only 500-1000 more. If youre checking bags, that will get covered with the upgrade so you’ll save a bit there. 

Did this one time and never went back. You have no idea how much better your whole experience will be. And hopefully you’re not flying to Asia, so it won’t be as expensive. Asian flights are ridiculously expensive.

Edit: I’ve been doing this for years and I have yet to miss out on the opportunity to upgrade. There seems to always be 2-3 seats available. As long as you check in early, you should make it.",3,0,13,13,,13,gk907,thebirdman619,0

What are your personal recommendations for dealing with a 10 hour flight?,"I travel a lot, so here are some of my personal tips.

\- Flights over 8 hours have TVs, watch movies, listen to music, or listen to the ambiance they have.

\-If there is nothing that interests you, spend a day or 2 before the flight to download music or movies on your phone or laptop and bring headphones with you (Preferably soundproof ones if you don't want to hear the outside world)

\-Most airlines give meals if your flight is over 8 hours, regardless of class. Dinner is usually 2 hours after takeoff and breakfast is 2 hours before landing. However, some don't so buy some snacks from the airport, it's expensive but what else can you do?

\-Customs isn't terrible, it takes about 10-20 minutes.

\-Put distinct markings on your baggage so you don't lose it (This goes for any flight)",1,0,13,13,,13,LaraTheIceFox,thebirdman619,0

* Get up and stretch regularly, sitting for that long is bad for circulation and is tiring and draining in its own way.

* Bring over the counter pain relief, decongestant, and antihistimine in case something triggers a headache, sinus problems, or an allergy etc.

* Track suits are very comfortable, bring layers so you can adapt to the situation. It's nice to have inside pockets or zipper pockets.

* Eye mask and ear plugs, and a neck pillow

* Drink water regularly but slowly

* Have spare earphones if you like listening to things. 

* Break up the time between playing games, watching a movie, tv, and reading, by breaking it up the time goes by a lot faster.  Playing calm word games or sudoku are great if you are trying to relax and fall asleep.

* Comfortable shoes and socks that allow your feet to swell.  Being at that high altitude for a long time causes some swelling.",1,0,13,13,,13,myhydrogendioxide,thebirdman619,0
What are your personal recommendations for dealing with a 10 hour flight?,"If you can afford it, don't fly economy. If you are in stuck with economy, try to get preferred seating. Not having a seat in front of you is great.

What are your personal recommendations for dealing with a 10 hour flight?,"Snacks, there's no guarantee you'll get anything beyond a small bag of pretzels, some flights offer more but not always. Better to be prepared with something you can eat than to get sick from hunger, especially if the snack ends up being something you don't like. 

Books, audio books, podcasts, music, shows or movies. Something you can enjoy with headphones on because sometimes you get noisy travelers and being able to turn them down to a dull roar is nice. 

Gum. The chewing can help with your ears if they get stuffed up during takeoff. Lozenges or some kind of hard candy because the air on the flight can be drying, and those help a little. 

Wear comfortable clothing, and shoes. Warm enough to keep you toasty because flights can get pretty cold, but easy to remove (sweater, wrap, jacket) in case you get stuck on the plane and they don't have the air going. It gets stuffy fast.

If you have one, a fully charged battery bank is also nice.",1,0,13,13,,13,Pascalica,thebirdman619,0

What changes did you make that improved your mental health?,"Realised at 41 that my anxiety, depression, PTSD, short temper, irritation at repetitive noises, frustration with crowds, dislike of people breaking minor rules, difficulty sleeping, constant confusion about people’s intentions, ability to hyperfocus, strong attachment to routines, identification with animals, dedication to personifying inanimate objects, extreme exhaustion after social gatherings, constant tiredness, frequent rage, drinking to excess and constant sense of loneliness and not belonging was…. AUTISM!  

Edit: For those of you asking about how I got here - I had an autistic friend, who encouraged me to start looking into this. There’s a clue for you all - neurospicy people tend to find each other, so if you have friends or family on the spectrum….   

I did a few things, first was to follow a few neurodiverse people and accounts on IG. They had some great resources. Then I read Unmasking Autism by Dr Devon Price and it was a complete eye opener. I have been heavily masked all my life. I have put aside time read the diagnostic criteria in the DSM; and looked for an read more papers and quizzes etc.   

I am self diagnosed: right now, I don’t have the money or time to go to a professional. I’ve been in therapy all my life, and where I live it would be an 18-24month wait to get an official diagnosis. I have other plans for the $1000s of dollars this would cost. I no longer work full time so money is tight.

More importantly, I also object to being assessed using nothing more than cultural standards that supposedly define normal. There’s no blood test or brain scan I can get. I just need to be observed against the criteria and answer questions - these are things I can do myself.  

A lot of people say autists have trouble making eye contact. I know I hate doing it, but I force myself to do it. How much eye contact is “normal”? No one can tell me, yet my apparent inability to get it “right” makes me “abnormal.” I reject that line of thinking, because it is telling me there is a rule I violate, yet it cannot identify the rule. It makes me feel like I’m defective, and I know I’m not, I’m just a bit unusual, and that’s OK. 

Having the language and understanding about myself has already helped immeasurably. I have explanations for why I feel or do things. That means I can think about solutions to things like “I hate noisy places” or “I find crowds enraging” and “I feel extremely confused right now.”   

Knowing this about myself saved my marriage, hands down, no doubt about it. 

A lot of what works for me is rest; reducing irritating input (eg wearing headphones, switching to soft utensils like silicone spatulas to do something like dish up food - I hate the clinking of a metal utensil on a dish); and accepting that I need to manage my energy carefully. I do a lot fewer things each day than I used to. I am trying to stop self-censoring and am unpacking a lot of shame. It’s hard work. 

My diagnosis came with a lot of grief and woundedness that none of my therapists or adults in charge ever saw this in me. Yet I fit the criteria so well.   How could this have been missed?
  
I believe that my being female, fairly articulate/heavily masked, having a university degree, working corporate full time and being married to a man played into this heavily. On paper I sound normal, if you meet me you’ll notice I’m a bit blunt, a bit of a people pleaser, and can have deep interests that others might find dull. 

But if I am alone and feel comfortable by myself I stim, vocalise, have melt downs and all sorts of other much more obvious autistic traits. I just got very, very good at hiding them from others.",126,0,2677,2677,,2677,EgonOnTheJob,Particular_Damage_58,0

Growing up my best friend would criticize everything about me. My hair, my clothes, my interests, the girls I liked. I know he thought he was helping me but it was pretty toxic.

1) **Adopting a healthy lifestyle**. Sleep is so overlooked, but having a healthy circadian rhythm is crucial. A clean diet, some regular exercise takes you the rest of the way. No drugs, limited alcohol (occasions), limited screen time, and more activities — especially the outdoors type. 

2) **Worked on past trauma**. I saw a counselor for a few sessions (not quite a psychologist) but it helped a lot with saying things I needed to say, and moving forward. I didn’t have anything super traumatic, otherwise this would be number one. 

3) **Added value through knowledge**. I definitely started reading more, and eventually went back to school and got my bachelor’s degree. This helped my career prospects and further added to my confidence. i was in Norway at the time, so I finally learned the language (my excuse was that everyone spoke English).  

Those are what worked for me. Regardless of what specific causes you have, I think there is a hierarchy of needs that need to be met. Start with the physiological and safety needs and work your way up to self esteem, and finally the aesthetic and self-actualization bits.

Even if I achieved nothing else that day, I achieved that. Mostly, however, it meant I had one tiny thing to build another tiny thing on top of. Over time it all adds up, and by the end of a horrible day, it wasn't so bad. But the end of the week, not so bad at all.

Where it led to was realising being down and thinking all I wanted to do was nothing isn't actually true. Turns out, being active and engaged and getting stuff down makes my mental wellbeing much much better.

Essentially, what I feel in advance will make me happier doesn't. What I don't want to do, actually does. It's weird, not obvious, and annoying, but has totally changed my life.

The only way I can summarise it is that 'happiness' is a feeling you only perceive AFTER the event, not during.",77,0,2677,2677,,2677,modelvillager,Particular_Damage_58,0

What changes did you make that improved your mental health?,"couple things —

worked my way into a job that pays me enough to *live*. i’m no longer paycheck to paycheck. i’m not loaded, but for a single guy like myself with no college education, it’s solid. i live alone and recently brought a brand new car (financed). i’m able to afford things that improve my quality of life instead of just scraping by at the bare minimum. money can’t buy happiness, no, but it fuckin’ *helps*. 

changed my diet… and mostly stopped drinking. i still do, lightly and socially, but i don’t keep any at home. it’s a depressant. furthermore, i’ve started eating more whole foods and cooking at home a lot more. you are what you eat, so *eat good*. 
on that note, certain supplements can help. i take something called ashwagandha. it’s an herbal supplement, which some people feel a certain type of way about, but… every time i start taking it, i’m genuinely surprised by how much better i feel. it’s one of the few supplements that’s really helped. i recommend it, a 3-month supply can be had for under $15. 

also, keeping a clean home is huge. i’m not meticulous, but i like being tidy. bed sheets get changed every week. dishes are washed daily. counters are wiped down, floors are vacuumed/swept once every week or two. we humans are a product of our environment, like it or not, so be clean and as organized as you can be. it keeps some of the inner demons at bay. 

tea is great. Yogi is a solid brand with a lot of great flavors. i’m brewing a cup of Bedtime right now. there’s something therapeutic about it, and a daily habit can be meditative. 

also, exercise. i struggle to find the motivation, but every time i finish even a quick 15-min body weight workout in my living room, i feel better. take a long walk around the neighborhood. our bodies are made to be moved — do it. it’s something.

I still made a ton of girl **friends**, but nobody was interested in anything more.  I probably collected like 30 friends from that year I was fat.

Always remember: hunger is OUT OF YOUR CONTROL, your body will force your brain to eat if you're hungry, that is why diets always fail, hunger is stronger than you

The key is to suppress your hunger

Your hunger is controlled by hormones (leptin, ghrelin, etc), so you need to control those hormones

Eat protein, fat and fiber in any quantity you want, and reduce all carb intake to as close to zero as you can

I cannot stress this enough, eat as much protein, fat and fiber as you want, fill yourself so you are not hungry AT ALL

Eat eggs, poultry, red meat, cheese, butter, fiberous green veggies (no starches) and avoid all sugar and all refined carbs (that means no bread, no processed foods, eat only whole foods)

Do this for 3-4 days and you will notice a huge reduction in your appetite, your hunger will literally change and you will feel it

Then start to reduce your total food intake day by day, add more green veg and reduce overall calories, it will be much easier

Have you ever done solo travelling? How was it?," Oh man, solo traveling is the bomb! I've done it a couple of times, and it's been a blast every time. There's something so liberating about being able to do whatever you want, whenever you want, without having to worry about anyone else's schedule or preferences.

The first time I went solo traveling was to Thailand, and it was amazing. I got to explore all these different cities and towns, try all kinds of new foods, and meet some really cool people along the way. Plus, I got to challenge myself and push myself out of my comfort zone, which was really empowering.

One thing I will say, though, is that solo traveling isn't for everyone. It can be a bit scary or overwhelming at times, especially if you're in a foreign country where you don't speak the language. But as long as you're smart about it and take precautions to stay safe, it can be an incredible experience.

If you're thinking about doing some solo traveling yourself, I'd say go for it! Start small with a weekend trip somewhere nearby, and then work your way up to longer trips and more far-flung destinations. And don't be afraid to put yourself out there and meet new people - some of my favorite travel memories are from the friends I've made along the way.

Anyway, hope that helps! Happy travels!",1,0,8,8,,8,Yahentamitsi,whotfusesredddit,0

Have you ever done solo travelling? How was it?,"Most of my traveling has been solo, including several trips to rural Sweden from the US.  Overall, I prefer a companion to speak to, but not one I have to take care of, like a young child. I also don't eat much while on the go, which seems rather rare, so I don't worry about meals, I lose weight, and have to watch my blood sugar levels more closely (I am a diabetic). Most of my anxiety is from boredom and ""omg what do I do now?"" when something goes wrong, but rarely does it get bad.

That being said, I hate going to landmarks and such by myself. In fact, when I went to Disneyland, I paid for my assistant at the time to go with me. They were a HUGE Disney fan, but didn't think they'd ever get to go. For me, it was cheap, because I had connections within the event industry, so to add someone else was a lot cheaper than if my assistant tried by themselves. PLUS, I got to experience Disneyworld through the eyes of a mega-fan, which made the entire experience a lot more enjoyable for me.

Have you ever done solo travelling? How was it?,"Solo traveled to Venice (and in-between, was planning much more).

I didn't plan ahead too well, it was hot, I slept terribly, I was stressed, I was lonely, the cities were too busy (as in, there was no respite from it, no nature to recharge and retreat from the noise), too much traveling in a given time.

I cut off my trip and flew back home the day after I visited Venice, after calling my parents crying in a state of panic. I was 26 and already studies abroad years before. I already had a job for years, almost a full on adult.

Solo traveling isn't my thing. I might try solo traveling by bike so I am not dependent on planning ahead too much and can just set my own pace and be in nature, but I've never had a worse holiday experience then when I was alone. I need to be with friends (or a friend) I can fall back on, even if it's just in my head and I am the one doing all the planning anyway. 

Solo traveling definately isn't the life changing secret to enlightenment the internet makes it out to be, especially if you are both someone who needs social interaction for mental health as well as having social anxieties/being shy/socially awkward. It's just a lot of stress about just being places you don't know, without the benefits of enjoying time with people you care about. Sometimes friends can be a drag but I would rather spend a day going to some museum I don't care about with friends than being alone in Rome for an extra day.",1,0,8,8,,8,ArrogantlyChemical,whotfusesredddit,0

What is your opinion on hitting children as punishment?,"There is overwhelming amounts of data that says it’s a bad method & actually creates and perpetuates worse behavior. People get all defensive because they were spanked as kids and “I turned out fine” which may very well be true but it doesn’t mean it’s effective or worthwhile to physically assault your child, which creates tons of psychological turmoil as well. It’s not good and it’s not effective and frequently creates the opposite intended behaviors. Not hitting your kid doesn’t mean a lack of discipline. It means not physically assaulting a child because you can’t communicate effectively. it’s a fact at this point.",40,0,25,25,,25,ben505,Queasy-Text-1439,0

Because it isn't until you have the kid and you see how they act that you make the real decision and no one here is gonna admit that .

Kids are different an need different types of discipline. Some kids don't respond to this. Some kids do. No you don't have to hit harder if it doesn't work. For Some kids a time out hurts a lot more. Some kids will sit in a corner and sing a song when they are supposed to be regretting what they did so time out really didn't do shit. 

Sometimes you have to take things away instead. Sometimes they don't give a crap what you take away.

What is your opinion on hitting children as punishment?,"1. A child may not understand the reason for the hitting, and teaching them to do/not do something based off fear is not going to make a very mentally healthy adult.

2. Why is hitting the way to go in terms of discipline? As a parent you're telling me you have NO other methods? That seems like a you problem and something you need to research or take classes for.

3. If you say you're fine and you were hit, are you really fine now that you want to physically harm your child? 

4. Do you expect your child to come to you when they are a bit older if something really bad happened and they need someone? Because they won't. I have many friends who were hit as a form of punishment and they would all rather die then come to their parents about anything, especially more serious things.

5. Do you potentially want to risk your child not wanting a relationship with you later in life? They may still want a relationship, but many won't. 

6. Why have kids if your plan is to use physical means to control them because you can't deal with emotions or being patient enough to explain to them why they can't do what they did, or why they need to do something.

7. You're teaching them that the people you love are allowed to physically and emotionally hurt you, and its actually for YOUR benefit. You're also trying to teach them hitting isn't ok, unless you're a loved one and it's to teach them a lesson to really benefit them.

If you've accidentally lost your shit and hit your kid, you aren't automatically a bad parent, but I would seek therapy and try to get support to improve your situation because it should never resort to violence with any child.",1,0,25,25,,25,sensitve_fig,Queasy-Text-1439,0
What is your opinion on hitting children as punishment?,"It's a real challenge for parents who were physically punished as children to learn other ways to have a positive impact on their children's behavior. Sometimes that leads to overly permissive parenting. 

It helped me to understand that all behavior, including my own, is communication. It seems counter intuitive, but when a child purposely does the thing to get attention, it's because they want attention and don't know a better way to ask for it. You can teach children better ways to recognize they want attention and how to ask for it. 

When they meltdown it's because they don't have tools to deal with their emotions. I find it helpful to label the feeling (you look angry), acknowledge that the feeling is valid (I sometimes feel angry too when someone tells me to stop having fun) and keep moving forward (the child is still taken from the fun thing to go do something else). Teaching and modeling how you want kids to seek attention and  handle their emotions is more effective over the long term than punishment or even ignoring.

My mom will hit my brother and I when we were kids (especially my elder brother) but it was always accompanied with her explaining why what we did was wrong and she will also allow us to voice our thoughts and opinions. Sometimes she will let us decide on how many strokes we think we deserve. It allows us to reflect on the mistake and to gauge the severity of it. She will also always hug us at the end of it.,1,0,25,25,,25,hansaplast0000,Queasy-Text-1439,0

The biggest difference is that the physical punishments still come back and give me anxiety. I have to work to forgive people for not knowing something that they themselves were a victim of.

It also teaches them that you hurt those you love, and that those who you love will hurt you - so it's better not to love, or be the one who hits.

What it *doesn't* teach them is to stop misbehaving - only that there is a cost if you're willing to pay the price, but if you're clever you can get away with it.

Not saying it's right, but sometimes people either don't get the support or help they need, or were pressured into having a kid that turned out to be something they end up regretting. Kids are hard work, especially during the first three years. It's very hard. They can scream and throw a tantrum that lasts for hours and when parents attempt to lift some old habits, the kid will not take it kindly and show it. Sadly this is why kids can end up being spoilt, because some parents would rather not deal with the tantrums and just have a peaceful day, not realising it's only going to make the behaviour worse, especually when they go to Nursary/school when the teachers will be the ones having to deal with the bratty behaviour.

That would probably mean that 98% of parents are evil. A lot of parents do it because they themselves were raised the same way. Some don't see an issue with it because they feel like the hitting didn't affect them much, and some plan not to hit their kids before having children, but then realize that breaking the family cycle is harder than it seems and just hit their kids like their parents did, because they feel like there's no better option, and it's all they know. I don't think it's right, but I do understand why a lot of parents do it.

I do take issue to parents who hit their children and then try to gaslight them when they're teens/adults by denying that the hitting happened at all. By all means, do what you want, but one way or another, you WILL have to face the consequences of your actions. Own up to your mistakes.

I was a little autistic kid, and I was slapped multiple times for doing things that I was having fun with, with no ill intentions behind them. I got no explanation for why what I did was wrong, or upsetting. No instruction on how to be better, I just got a slap and was expected to buck up, it was not helpful, it just made me fearful.

"Calm people of Reddit, what made you snap?","My dad. It’s been weighing on my conscience for months now because of how I screamed at him. He didn’t really raise me as a kid, and always has been just within the far reaches of my orbit. I instead was raised by my mom. Every time he would seek me out as an adult, he’d always want something from me, money, a ride, etc. He’s an old man now, and lived a very tough life so I offer what I can when I can. Though my relationship with him is estranged, my mom always taught me to respect my elders. 


My goal for the last two years was to put a stable roof over my head and my mom’s head so they both can live their last years peacefully. To make a longer story short, I understand their history together and understand why they didn’t get along. My mom has grown in her age, and has forgiven my dad for some things. Enough that they can be in the same room together without a straight up argument, though they can bicker at times. However, that’s not what makes me mad. My dad just showed up to my front door about a year ago. He said he needed a place to stay. He did it without any notice or any aforementioned heads up. He said he needed just a month or so while he found a new place. He ended up staying with me for over 10 months. He was a mess. Constantly leaving messes. Making me plan my life around his. He never followed the rules. My landlord was feeling uncomfortable with him around and started to throw hints to me to leave because of how my dad was acting. Multiple times, I begged my dad to change. He just didn’t care, he never did. He had a bad habit of telling me lies all the time. I asked him why he always would lie to me. His response was that he was old, and he wasn’t going to be living with my mom and I much longer (despite not giving us a date when he was leaving). He said he was entitled to do whatever he wanted, and that included lying. I was so livid because I offered him a place to eat, a place to sleep, cared for him and drove him around without charging him a dime and he still couldn’t even tell me the truth when my relationship with him was already estranged. When I yelled at him for that, I felt awful, and to this very day I still do.

We have 138 slots to fill each night and I'd say most nights we miss a carton or two. A single item not stocked is enough for him to complain about it. But that wasn't what set me off.

What set me off was that he does this every single night that an item isn't stocked, and that very day he didn't just forget to stock a carton himself... he forgot to stock **8** cartons, **3** drinks, check off on a *single one of the 12* tasks, or sign the log book.

"Calm people of Reddit, what made you snap?","My mom. First off I love the woman. But I lived at home until I was 27. I was a bum for awhile. Got a part time job.

But she just wouldn't leave me alone. I understand my house my rules. But I was paying my fair share. I respected rules like no drugs in the house because I did have 2 siblings much younger than me. Sister is 6 years younger and brother is 8. Plus I didn't do any drugs. I smoked and eventually quit.

I worked my job for a few years and saved up some money and took my fiance and I about 800 miles away. Worked a few more years and we bought our first house last year. I haven't cut my mother off. We talk fairly regular. But I dealt with her shit for years that out of spite I moved away. And I moved far enough away that it's just inconvenient enough for anyone to take a short trip home.

It sucks because I'd like to visit other family. And it's really hard to take a trip home when the drive is 12 hours each way. But on the other hand it's worth it because I don't have to deal with the guilt trips of ""you're only 2 or 3 hours away why don't you come home for the weekend"".

What are your thoughts on leashes for children?,"When my daughter was 2 she decided to run away from me for fun. she was looking behind at me while she ran towards a busy road. I was only a second or two away from her but she was only a second or two away from the road, she'd caught me off guard, and she was determined to escape. at the time it wasn't clear to me if I could reach her before she reached the road even as I started running towards her.

A friend of mine grabbed her maybe 2 toddler's paces from the road and everything was fine, but had my friend not been there the outcome might have been tragic. I wished I'd had a leash that day.

I love my daughter with all my heart, she's been my world since she was born, but kids that age are basically like wild animals that don't understand many of even the most obvious of dangers, so I guess I'm all for anything that helps me to stop them from killing themselves in traffic.

I’m a single parent of an autistic nonverbal six year old and it’s typically just us two doing everything together.

What are your thoughts on leashes for children?,"When I was a child, I had this weird habit of looking behind me as I walked. I am also severely ADHD.

Fortunately, I was found, in my bright neon swimsuit, with a park employee, holding his hand and freaking looking behind me. 

My nephew was a runner. Youngest niece bolts like she belongs in the dang Olympics. 

All the older folks in the family maintain that every child in our family needs a leash. I heartily agree. For the dumb kids like me who can’t look the hell forward and look up to the wrong adult to the kids who act like squirrels in the street…Leash. That. Child.

We all outgrew that though. I only looked backwards for a year or so, my nephew got a painful lesson in not bolting off (another kid who also bolted slammed into him and he got a naaasty concussion). Niece is still very young and has zero concept of danger because little kids don’t when they are in a good, safe home. When she gets bigger, she’ll start to understand and we won’t have to worry about her bolting in front of a car, to the horses (There’s a reason I teach my horses to not panic over weird human things), or to the goats (my bucks think it’s funny but my mama goats were very unimpressed and unappreciative of her enthusiastic greeting)",6,0,539,539,,539,farmerthrowaway1923,Specialist-Event-250,0

People like to talk about parents controlling their kids and being involved or whatever, but the reality is sometimes you need two hands when you're out and about, which means you have to let go of your kid. It might only be for five or ten seconds (say, to find your keys in your purse, or put on your coat, or take your credit card out of your wallet), but that's more enough time for a kid to get into trouble.

I was walking about 10 feet away from the road edge. Walking towards me a young mother holding her toddler’s hand. He was maybe 3 and closest to the roadway. With one quick motion the kid pulled has hand out of the mothers and turned directly towards the road heading towards it with a toddler’s speed. 

Just as the kid stepped on the road a van went by and if there was a guardian angel around… I witnessed a miracle. The van slipped past the kid within a hair. The air pressure created pushed the child back and onto his ass. The mother who had frozen in her tracks… finally woke up and grabbed the kid off the road before he could get up.

**Strapped into a stroller or similar:** Not great for exercise and development but the kid is safe and no one complains. Except the kid who invariably wants oooooooout. 

**Holding adult's hand:** Sweaty palms, kid's arm goes numb holding it over their head all the time, shoulder issues from when they yank on it, parents' back hurts from bending over, neither kid or parent can do anything properly because their hands are occupied.  But socially acceptable. 

**Running free:** It takes 2 seconds for a child to run into traffic, get lost, get kidnapped, break something, get hurt..... and face it - they run faster than you. So best case scenario, you have to chase them.  Also people complain you aren't keeping your kid in check. All around worst opiton. 

**Leash:** No danger, no injury, no arm discomfort, no back pain, kid feels free and independent while parent can ensure safety.

so I was a child of the 80s.  My parents used car seats for a very limited amount of time.  We rode in the back and front seats at very early ages.  No seatbelts needed because my parents were amazing drivers.  Any parents that got into accidents were lazy horrible parents.  If they were doing their jobs, they would be able to anticipate every possible outcome on the road.

My parents taught us not to open the windows or try to open the doors.  They didn't need the child locks on the back doors because damn it, they weren't lazy.  We knew at 2 or 3 the actual consequences of our actions.

My parents wanted us to be kids and not treated like animals and be belted in without the freedom to move.  Can you imagine how that would have messed with my self esteem and general psychological development if my parents basically caged me within the car?

Thank God they loved me enough to treat me as a person with the high functioning cognitive skills I truly possessed as a toddler.

And anyways if for some reason they had to stop fast my parents were so amazing they could shoot out their right arm and block me from hitting the dashboard.  They were amazing.

The other day I saw a kid who had to be 9 sitting in a booster seat.  How lazy are those parents that they need an additional restraint for their child?  It has to be so embarrassing for the child to be locked up like an animal and not be able to even lay down if they want.

Mine were always pretty calm and didn't do the darting and running away. They always knew that if they got out of sight to stand still as we would find them, not the other way around. Sure, distractions existed, but they were never out of control, outside of one instance when my youngest decided he need to use a bathroom without telling any of us when he was 3.

We never had a problem going to cities, or tourist spots, and herding them all around.

Inequality: Economic inequality is growing in many parts of the world, with a small number of individuals and corporations controlling a disproportionate amount of wealth and power.  
  
Discrimination: Racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of discrimination continue to be major issues in many societies, leading to unequal opportunities and outcomes for marginalized groups.  
  
Human rights abuses: Many governments and organizations engage in human rights abuses, including torture, extrajudicial killings, and censorship, among other things.

Banning for the public, no of course not, makes zero sense.   


Theactual concern about spying or something through an App, I can't think of any app I'd be less worried about, because why would I ever care if the Chinese spied on me, which I think is nonsense anyway.... but I'd be 100x more concerned with my own government spying on me which I know they do because I know they have backdoors in messaging software.

The movie finished, mom picked us up 15 minutes late and drove us to her place. She had a lengthy driveway so I walked her down it and as we did I said ""I gotta warn you.

[Serious] What do you think about common or standard hallucinations?,"Well, I think that common or standard hallucinations can be both fascinating and scary at the same time. It's interesting to learn about the different types of hallucinations people experience and how they can vary from person to person. But on the other hand, it's also concerning because if someone is experiencing a hallucination, it can be difficult for them to distinguish between what's real and what's not. It's important for those experiencing hallucinations to seek professional help to understand and manage their symptoms.

People with divorced parents: what is life like?,"I grew up with divorced parents.  I was 5 and my sister was 6 when they split. I was fortunate  that they cared enough about us to remain polite to each other. Never friendly.  Just cordial.  Talking about the weather.  ""How's work going "". That kind of stuff. 

It wasn't until my sister found their divorce papers and other stuff that we found out they had a nasty divorce.  Restraining orders, lawsuits between my dad and grandparents,  lawsuits between my mom and my paternal uncles.   All over cars and money, etc. Child support fights, alimony, visitation hearings,  etc. The works. It was ugly. 

 We were both in college when my sister found the papers.  Until then, my parents had managed to be in the same room for parties, graduations, etc. They drove us to and from each others homes for vacations and visits. They helped us buy the other parent birthday,  Christmas,  and other holidays cards and gifts.  They never spoke bad about the other parent.  All during and after all the court stuff. 

I look back and I find it astonishing.  This was during the 70's and 80's.  I don't know how social media would have changed this.  I feel terrible for kids that have parents using them for tug of war.  We were lucky. It can be done.

What is the worst way you've ever heard of someone dying?,"As someone mentioned Hisashi Ouchie was quite cruel due to the prolonged suffering, however there are a few other notrious cases that were quite gruesome. 

Nutty Putty Cave incidident: There was that guy who got stuck head first in a narrow path in a cave. Even though people tried to rescue him and nearly succeeding he died in the end due to suffocation after 28 hours. 

James Prout: A vulnerable man tortured for weeks and ultimately killed by some sickos which can nearly be described as cult like. 

Byford Dolphin Accident: Five saturation divers on an oil rig were killed because one of them made a mistake in which the diving bell was disconnected from the living chamber before the living chamber was closed properly which lead to an explosive decompression, which means the crew members literally just exploded in an instant. They probably didn't feel much but it was pretty gruesome. 

Junko Furata: For me the most disturbing one because of how vile her death was. She was just 17 years old and got kidnapped by some class mates. She was held hostage for 44 days, during that time she was raped repedeatly and also beaten and tortured. I will not go into detail here. But one of the perpetrators apparently lost a game of Mahjong and then decided to let out his frustration on Junko by beating her and ultimately setting her on fire, leading to her death in the end.  It really must have been hell. The case was highly discussed because a lot of people thought the sentences for the perpetrators was too low for what they did.

What is the worst way you've ever heard of someone dying?,"She wasn't dead yet but she was dying. I hope she's dead 

Patient in ICU when I was in clinical. She had a cardiac arrest months ago and was paralyzed (vegetable) from anoxic brain injury. We got her from one of the shittier nursing homes. She coded in the ER several times and they kept bringing her back. Eventually she was stabilized enough for us to get her. She had a trach and was being mechanically ventilated, maxed out on vasopressors to keep her BP from tanking.

She had pneumonia. She had a catheter with a UTI. She had c.diff. From sepsis and the cardiac arrest, her temperature kept rising and she had a fever of +105.

She had c.diff and a rectal tube. She had infected pressure sores on her sacrum and both hips so no matter which way she was turned, she was lying on one of them. The rectal tube leaked liquid stool around the balloon and was soaking the sacral wound bandage in feces. They kept inflating the balloon of the rectal tube which pushes the leaking stool against the rectal wall so she was probably developing necrosis in her rectum and on her way to dissolving her intestine.

Her family wouldn't make her DNR. When her son wouldn't even stay on the call long enough for the doctor to ask to make her DNR because he was too busy. I don't know what she did to him for him to let us keep torturing her. 

I could see one of her eyes following me and had a feeling she was still in there, completely paralyzed with no way to communicate while her body rotted while she was still alive, being brought back over and over again with no hope for recovery.

My uncle, who was busy being the father of the bride was  making the rounds and welcoming all the guests. When he got around to me and the table of kids, he picked me up and asked me how I was, and my reply was bored. He pulled out his Nintendo Game & Watch and passed it to me while saying ""I'll be right back"". My uncle's on my mom's side were amazingly cool men, Reinhardt was the definition of cool in my book. 

Approximately 5 or so minutes later, here comes my uncle Ronnie holding an entire serving tray of ""pigs in the blanket"" which in the US are mini sausages, or hot dogs wrapped in a puff pastry. My favorite snack food.

He had a huge smile on his face and proceeded to hand me the entire tray. At the exact same time he turned purplish blue and collapsed.

He was dead before he hit the floor. Massive heart attack.

There were several nurses in attendance, who immediately started CPR, to no avail.

This event was so horrific , on so many levels, it is still incomprehensible and painful.

There was a bridge across the port, and my family, never shy when talking about death, mentioned from time to time people killing themselves by jumping from the bridge. Not a lot, of course, but it happened.

I always found it dumbfounding because I knew the place: the water is not very deep, and the bridge is definitely not very high. It seemed like a poor way to kill yourself to me.

Once, during one of those conversations, I told my grandmother what a stupid choice for dying I thought it to be.
She looked at me and said « It’s not height, or the fall that kills them. Under the water there’s a deep layer of mud. People who jump get stuck in it, can’t get out of it, and drown ». And since she was pretty generous when it came to burning horrifying pictures in my head, she added « We often find them a few days afterwards, with shrimps where their eyes used to be ».

For this who don’t know the name, the Collyer brothers were recluse hoarders in New York and in the 1940s both of them died.

Homer’s brother Langley had set up traps because people kept breaking in once rumors of treasure started to spread. One day Langley was crawling through a tunnel to bring Homer, who was totally blind, his dinner and accidentally triggered one of the traps. The tunnel collapsed, killing him. Homer was only ten feet away so he likely heard it, but sat there helpless for something like two weeks slowly starving to death.

Final irony, when a neighbor noticed the smell of Langley decomposing, called the police, and the police broke into the brownstone, Langley had only been dead about five hours.

They had a series of guides for doing business in different places in the world.  Here is the first section about New York.  Pretty accurate, I think.

Business etiquette – New York  
  
• If someone appears confrontational, do not take it personally: brashness is simply part of the city's competitive work culture. Many New Yorkers pride themselves on being blunt and pushy, but you may well be surprised by how helpful New York's strangers can be.  
  
• Hire a good lawyer. Nothing gets done in New York with a handshake.  
  
• It is surprisingly easy to offend racial, religious or cultural sensibilities. America's strict discrimination laws are particularly noticeable here. Asking a potential employee's age, for example, is not allowed (and socially it is taboo). Sexual harassment cases often lead to expensive law-suits.  
  
• The pace of business can be frantic, so prepare yourself for breakfast meetings at 7am. Punctuality is expected, but given New York's antiquated and congested transport system, some lateness is tolerated.  
  
 • Business lunches tend to be dominated by work matters; the focus is not on the food and drink. Smoking (now banned in all restaurants and bars) is usually seen as a sign of weakness, not sophistication. The liquid lunch is a rarity: most New Yorkers stick to sparkling mineral water.",5,0,10,10,,10,WillingPublic,Shadrach183,0

Best of luck telling that to China, India, America, Germany, Japan, et al.....

It ain't going to happen and no amount of virtue-signalling with EVs, heat pumps, carbon capture and tree planting will make a ha'porth of difference, I believe.

At this point, I’m getting more and more and more comfortable just living my life being 100% single. It’s just so tiring out there. And if I hear, one more time, something along the lines of “if happens when you’re not looking” from family or friends again, I will lose it 😅",1,0,198,198,,198,txmsh3r,Zdvj,0

Rather then make something of themselves or find another oppertunity, they just sit all day at home, living off the government and watching videos on their phones. Someone actually once told me she knows people who don't bother going to work because they get more money by claiming benefits then spending hours going to work. 

Thing is, I honestly cannot live with myself having no job and not contributing to anything or building myself up. I love working hard and achieving things. I just find it so sad that there are people out there who simply give up or won't bother achieving anything.

Absolute nightmare. Trapped in my house and I just spiraled out of control. Around 2am, a severe thunderstorm rolled through and I just continued to fall further and further. 

Anyway, when it cleared up the next day I just felt terrible. Exhausted but so alert. I called my mother and admitted what happened and she comforted me. Really needed it. She assured me that what I was feeling wasn't real and that I was going to be alright. Haven't touched it since.

I kept trying to talk to my friend because I was scared, but he couldn’t understand me. I tried texting and showing him, he still couldn’t understand me and I was going crazy. We went upstairs and passed his grandfather, who I apologized for for being on acid, and I went to sleep on my friends couch


A week later I talk to this friend and apologize for telling his grandfather I was on acid

There was no grandfather. He wasn’t there the entire time we were there. There were also no sirens or cop lights. I also was talking in gibberish the whole time and when I showed him my phone—I showed him garbled nonsense. I hallucinated it all, haven’t done acid since 🤣",8,0,10,10,,10,BojangleHeimerShmidt,EgGbeAter_69,0

But i did once make the mistake of smoking weed on shrooms. Some love it but it wasn't fun for me. I just suffered memory loss (the weed) which combined with the loss of understanding of the passage of time (thhe shrooms) made me feel trapped in some kaleidoscope visioned plane of existence for longer than i was comfortable haha.

I went to the bathroom took a piss and washed my hands, I must have forgotten to dry them cause I walked out into the main room and dried them on my pants.

At that point I asked the room if I pissed my pants (reality was my hands were wet). The room went nuts and I became the butt of jokes and people started messing with me because they new I was out of my head space.

The important thing is to do it with trusted friends.

Everything was wonderful at the forrest. I remember seeing a purple flower and I've never felt such thing for a colour. Everything was so vivid and majestic. The trees were moving and I thought they were alive like animals.

I also couldn't keep my mouth shut. I was saying anything that came to my mind and some things I would be embarrassed to say even if I was drunk.

The second time was nice too. Until another group of strangers came at this isolated beach. They set up their tent away from us but I felt really uneasy. 

This became worse when one of them came to us to ask for something (cigarettes or smthng I don't remember).
I freaked out and felt violated. How could they come to our beach and approach us?! I wanted to leave immediately.

I started packing some random stuff and started walking. Luckily my friends managed to calm me and after an hour we joined their group and had a great time.

"Married couples of Reddit, how often and how bad do fights get during your relationship? Are fights/disagreements the norm?","Fights are not the norm if you picked someone you are actually compatible with and you knew each other before marrying.

Occasional moodiness is acceptable, but healthy people apologize for it and healthy partners don't overreact to what is obviously moodiness/crankiness.

Speaking or feeling passionately about something isn't fighting.  Disagreeing about some things is fine, you aren't clones that share a single mind.  Remembering that the person you are disagreeing with us someone you care about and don't want to hurt is important.  If you find yourself trying to hurt them, with words or actions, there's more wrong than whatever you're currently disagreeing about.",2,0,3,3,,3,Eve-3,arceedian93,0

When we realized what was happening, we agreed to only fight about things for which there are definite verifiable truths. 

""Your sister doesn't like me,"" or"" You don't respect me,"" or "" are you wearing THAT out of the house?"" do not present opportunities for verifiable truth. Ponder the difference and you will fight less.",1,0,3,3,,3,ChristopherChiller,arceedian93,0

To all flat earthers: if the earth is flat what is on the underside?,"It's possible that the area beneath the earth is the main energy input of the Universe, the 2nd big energy input being the sun. Possibly at the bottom of the universe, underneath the earth there is an exponentially expanding source of quark-gluon plasma that cools as it rises. The quark-gluon plasma accelerates the surface of the earth upwards at a usually constant rate of 9.8 meters per second per second.

The quark-gluon plasma cools into heavy liquid radioactive metals which are the source of geothermal heat. At higher levels much of these radioactive metals have decayed into lighter more stable metals such as Iron.

Because space is so cold, the surface of the earth has frozen into the familiar rock and soil. However, sometimes the intense force pushing the earth up is clearly seen in volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.",2,0,13,13,,13,draoi28,Nordic_Vampire_Bat,0

The firmament could be electromagnetic “bubbles” kind of like what the sun lets loose but they stay in place like a magnetic field would. 

Sun/moon I have no answers or thoughts🤷🏻‍♂️ but my suggestion kind of satisfy most observations. Like pictures from low earth orbit only and that it shows a continent but not the entire earth. Or cgi depictions/alterations of a full shot of earth etc. maybe earth really is much larger and old maps are correct in that there are continents beyond the “poles” as Richard Byrd said.",1,0,13,13,,13,AwesomeParker,Nordic_Vampire_Bat,0

See how rainbows are curved, that means there's a big dome on earth.

What small changes could someone make that will completely improve their life?,"Go to the gym 4 days a week for 45 minutes each time. Day 1 = heavy lower body. Day 2 = off. Day 3 = Heavy upper body. Day 4 = Off. Day 5 = dynamic lower body. Day 6 = Dynamic upper body. Day 7 = off.

Eat 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight and the rest fruit, vegetables, and whole grains. 

That is all it takes. Seriously...you don't have to spend hours and hours in the gym. You can still have a donut for breakfast. If you can find someone who does Westside Barbell in your area, join a group class. I know everyone hates on powerlifting, but I did bodybuilding for years and it is not the same at all. I was hungry, I looked skinny and had a six pack, but women didn't notice me at all.

45 minutes with a coach 4 times a week now in a group class costs me $30 a month + gym membership, so I'm in it for less than $75 a month and I'm top 5% lifter. 

I started doing this and women appear to like the bigger look. I've had women rub my arms, touch my back, randomly grab me. It's crazy. 3 hours a week. 1.7% of your week at the gym lifting on a decent program (get a coach to help you make sure you're doing it right and push you).

"People who grew up in those small, rural towns we all drive past: what was it like?","Rural southern Mississippi. Agricultural community, lots of farms and ranches.  My town had a population of around 600 people.  I was bused to a public school in a neighboring town of about 2,500 people.  I lived there from birth until I moved away to college, late 70s until early 90s.  It’s important to note that I am white and all of the families in my little community were white.

Pros: All the peace and privacy you could stand.  No one around me lived on less than 10 acres of property. Most people lived on 50 or more.  I had no neighbors in seeing distance.  When I was home alone I could crank up my guitar amp and absolutely no one could hear me.

It was also beautiful.  Gentle hills, plenty of mature trees.  Enough shade that the Southern summer wasn’t so rough.

You’d hear about the occasional drug crime or property crime, but anything other than petty crime was pretty rare.

Cons: Everything is inconvenient. The closest gas station was 12 miles away. The closest grocery store was 20 miles away.  The closest hospital was an hour long drive away.

We had to manage our own well water.  Most of my neighbors had septic tanks, but we were lucky enough to have a good hill for our house, so we had a gravity-based waste system. But that meant we had to stock a pond with fish and maintain a proper ecosystem, lest it turn into a cesspool.

Most people were small-minded.  They never ventured far from the area and never wanted to do so.  They knew almost nothing of other cultures.  Oddly enough, many of the older folks in my community, particularly the males, were more open minded because many of them had served in World War 2 or the Korean War.  They had actually seen more of the world and had somewhat more worldly views.

To say this community was conservative is an understatement.  Strongly anti-LGBTQ.  Strongly anti-abortion.  Strongly anti-government, and not particularly pro-military, oddly enough.  Most folks had tales of abusive small town judges or deputies.  Many men my father’s age had been drafted to serve in Vietnam and did not have fond memories of it.

Although no non-whites lived in my little community, the town where I went to school was about 30% African-American.  The casual racism was real.  Many of the children my age had parents who were part of school integration.  I had Black friends from youth sports leagues in another town, but only a couple of Black friends at my school.  In fact, I got barked at by both some good ol’ boys and a few Black male schoolmates for dancing with a Black lady friend of mine at a school dance.

I don’t regret the experience overall.  I made a few lifelong friends and learned a higher degree of self-sufficiency.  I have since lived in mid-sized cities and suburbs, which are far more convenient.  I don’t think I’ll repeat the rural experience.",215,0,181,181,,181,YourUncleCraig,Austintatious_,0

It's actually peacefull knowing you are private and it's adifferent sort of peace. We were in the bush tho so Animals were always around in some form. I had a few friends there.

- Having a tab. That isn’t a thing in big cities. 
- Never having to call a tow truck if you get stuck/broken down. Someone you know will eventually see you and help. 
- The same postal code across town and easy to remember everyone’s phone number since only the last 4 digits were different 
- Class sizes of 9-20 and having to split up in high school since there was no local high school. 
- If you wanted to hangout with people, you just went outside. The empty streets would be littered with children. 
- No fast food or chains. 
- Homophobia. The pride sidewalk has been repainted multiple times. 
- Any crime being “big talk” in town since it was so rare. Any crime that happened was because the gas station was on a major highway and they would get robbed since there was no police in town. Other than that, just the occasional car break in.",19,0,181,181,,181,mwaterfalls,Austintatious_,0

Be home for dinner at dusk basically, then back out to play hide and seek in the dark. Bike riding adventures, fishing, so much unsupervised activities.

As a teen a bit less fun because let's face it, teens are a different animal. However, bonfires at the lake or ponds were awesome. Random keggers in the woods. 4 wheeling, trail riding, ATVs, so on and so forth.

As an adult, so much better than any city I've lived in. I thought I wanted out of the woods. Nope, I ended up going back. Neighbors might be 2 miles away but you can count on them for anything, unlike in the city, where they live right beside you and pretend you don't exist. Peace and quiet, everyone knows everyone. Got an emergency repair at home and it's not pay day yet? Joe at the hardware store has your back, ""get me when you get paid"".  Community.

It does have its downsides, big stores like Walmart and home Depot are 30 minutes or more drive away. Hospitals too. Road maintenance is often overlooked by the county for the big city. Everyone knows everyone's business. That can be good or bad. Nothing is open past about 9pm, so if you need something you get to wait or drive a fair distance. Same with jobs, typically few or fewer jobs that don't pay well, so again you make do or drive to one.

Still friends with these people today and regularly visit them and their families. They're some of the best and nicest people I've ever known. That said, far too many are casually racist and every single Republican stereotype you can think of. Not all but quite a few. There's also kind of a nobility system where if you aren't part of one of the big farming families, you're not really someone.

Closest movie theater is an hour drive so you could say dating was difficult. Pretty much everyone is some level of poor but no ever goes hungry. There's so little to do you pretty much just party or get up to redneck hijinks like shooting, dirt bikes, bonfires and so on.

"People who grew up in those small, rural towns we all drive past: what was it like?","I moved up to one last year. Shopping is a struggle: just a general store (also the post office), a pub, and a petrol (gas) station. Food is marked up a decent bit, since we're 70km from the nearest grocery store. And if you need gluten free food you're stuffed, your only options are things like chips or sometimes sausages if they're in stock.

There are no jobs available out here. There's just not enough shops or services compared to the number of people that live here. And most of the job listings in this town are restricted to indigenous people (Australia, Northern Territory, it's a common thing to help out the population we screwed over years ago.) 

It's quiet... sometimes. Other times theres music blaring from 2 or more houses. Dogs are always barking. People like to walk around yelling and setting off everyone's dogs. Everyone knows everyone's business, heck you can just sit inside and listen to the arguments and bogans swearing at each other for a few hours; great entertainment if you're not trying to sleep.

Honestly wish I knew what the food situation was like before I moved here. Having celiacs disease and having to drive 70km to pickup food, only for it to be sold out... My car died the day I got it transported and picked up. I rely on lifts to town, since there is no public transport. I've gone a few weeks without being able to get to town, living off the almost nothing I can eat in town. I've lost a lot of weight, mainly due to going hungry. One meal a day because when I can afford to buy a lot of food, the gluten free stuff is out of stock. Buying a weeks worth of food and making it stretch 2 weeks.

There's a gas station, a cafe, a pretty big hotel (it's resort country), a grocery store.  That's about it.  There a bait shop.  There used to be a school but they consolidated with the next town over.  It was foolish to do so, but the overall district is big enough that the larger town's votes destroy any chance of the small towns having a say.

As a kid, work in the winter was logging, in the summer was resort work.  The school was open campus.  Very lax about attendance and disipline.  Most teachers treated you like an adult.  You'd play basketball with them after school.  Quality of education was good. There were college level classes offered which was nice.

You drive a lot. My house was 15 miles from town so pretty close.   If you said that you were ""Going to town"" that meant Virginia, MN on the Range.  Sometimes Hibbing but usually Virginia.  It was fun to make a run to Duluth but that's a 2 hour drive so you kind of have to make a day of it.

Teens are teens like anywhere with the exception of no real cliques, minimal bullying, general friendliness, and supportive behavior.  Orr is a very accepting place in general compared to other places that I've lived.

"People who grew up in those small, rural towns we all drive past: what was it like?","I spend half my pre-adult life traveling to a small Louisiana town called Bogalusa to visit my Mom's family.  The town was maybe 10,000 population which barely supported a Crown Zellerbach paper factory.  The factory pumped out a horrible orange dust that fell primarily on those nearest the plant, as one might expect in the south, poor black areas \[but some ""suburb"" areas as well\].  As kids we would see the cloud and try to hold our breaths as Dad drove through as quickly as the speed trap through town allowed.  Looking back I feel very, very sorry for the people directly infected and can only imagine how diseases have resulted from the exposure.

Once through town and on my Grandfather's farm \[mostly outside the pollution zone\] as kids we were excited to help pick watermelons and help him sell them for $1 each from the back of his pickup truck.  I wish I had a few of those today.  Everyone knew everyone else and the few family which were stuck in the area were as one might imagine, very limited on choices of mates.  

One was known by the church they attended and many knew the exact date upon which they had been ""saved'.  Most families had been in the area for three or more generations.  There were family tales fashioned with the personalities of those in previous generations, often making them appear in our imaginations as larger than life.  More than a few tales revolved around a long standing feud in my Grandfather's generation, which ended in a murder on my Grandfather's front porch a few years before I was born.

It was never spoken of directly but there was an oppression of anything that remotely challenged the prevailing religious winds.  My Dad having grown up in the area and the ""Voodoo City"" \[New Orleans\] fought that oppression of knowledge and I inherited that fight from him.  Having an inquisitive mind, it didn't take long to embarrass local church members by asking questions for which they had no plausible answer and to which they most often resorted to the tired and true, ""he works in mysterious ways"" which I interpreted \[and still do\] to mean, ""Meh, we don't know, stop asking, you are embarrassing us.""  The dichotomy of saying what they believed on Sunday and their often duplicitous actions through the next Saturday night was not lost on me.

I enjoyed the sense of community and caring for one another but not the drama that was always present as well.  I do not miss the limited venue for learning and expanding one's mind.  \[The town library was a joke\] 

The best thing that happened to me was going to college two hundred miles away, completing a program in Aviation, then off to Uncle Sam's Flying Club \[USAF\] training and then being assigned to fast movers and living on three continents.

Proud of their town, despite it being in a deep state of financial and structural decay. Proud of their restaurant, despite all the health code violations and terrible food because no competition means no reason to _try_. Proud of their heritage, despite every old person being able to point out where the cross burnings used to take place. Proud of the local industry, despite it leaving your local high school literally sinking into the ground because of the mine shafts the company never bothered to secure before they up an left town after the coal ran dry.

Proud proud proud. 

Small towns fucking suck. Isolation, lack of competition, ethnocentricity, and forms of Christianity far more dangerous than most of you realize are the driving engines of all social dynamics in small town America. The smiles are ever-present, but fake. The welcome is only warm in so much as you are like them, and the shotguns are kept close at hand for the rest. The land is beautiful beyond description, but cursed by the human parasites who desecrate it for fossil resources.

"People who grew up in those small, rural towns we all drive past: what was it like?","Both my first wife and my second wife (we are widows) came from different small towns in West Virginia. My first wife I was married to for 25 years, and used to listen to her talk to people back home. Plus we traveled a lot. She was embarrassed to be from her home town when she was younger. They were nestled in between the mountains, and the only TV she saw was from cable TV, which was piped in from Washington DC about a 3 hour drive from them. They had a sports announcer from the local (DC local) news, and when he visited their small town, they threw him a parade and had a bronze plaque made with his name engraved where he sat at the bar. That plaque was still there, polished every day, some 15 years later. At the time, my wife said, ""I am so embarrassed for this town.""  But when she got older, she really missed a lot of her youth, and the entire former coal mining town was dying. Every time we returned, there was more of it boarded up and run down. The weird thing for me (I grew up and stayed near DC) is that i have all this ""lore"" about this small town and nobody to talk to about it.

My second wife came from a different part, a farming community near a town that was sleepysville. ""My biggest crime was I was not born to local names,"" she told me, because her parents were teachers who traveled there to teach at the nearby college and high school, and thus she was never ""accepted"" because she was an ""out of towner.""  She left to join the military out of college, so she never really went back until her parents were dying some 30 years later. I was with her during that time, and she told me how much things had changed. ""We didn't even have a fast food place, we had to drive 30 miles to a Burger King in another town, and now they have 4 fast food places in my hometown.""

What if you are offered 500$ a day but you have to throw away ever piece of litter you see?,"This isn't a hypothetical, as almost every country has some deposit-refund system (DRS), a development from the DRS originally offered by the manufacturers directly to consumers. When the [system is properly optimized](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652619345305) (and note in many communities [the DRS has fallen woefully behind modern times](https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/03/15/modernizing-bottle-bill-plastic-recycling), with the same 5-cent price as from 40 years ago when a nickel was worth slightly more), a person can make a significant amount of money by collecting bottles and cans from the streets (and, less productively for society, from peoples' bins) -- hence seeing homeless people with shopping carts full of them.

If you live in a city with an updated DRS (perhaps 25 cents return in the U.S., with inflation adjustment and some applicable subsidies), much less an optimized DRS (depends on the economy of the city, but I'd expect an even higher return), you could get $500 from 2000 bottles and cans. As the average American drinks a can of soda per day, you could make your rounds at the recycling bins around apartment buildings and probably collect this within two or three hours -- though it would be more efficient to wait until trash day. In terms of collecting from the street all day long, I suppose that depends on the city and the nooks you find -- there are going to be some corners where the wind patterns will cause the trash to accumulate both on streets and on the shorelines.

The point of all this is that this is something that may be possible to do already in your neighborhood. If your neighborhood's DRS is not priced high enough that you *don't* think this is possible (or that you personally still don't feel it's worth your effort to get the deposit), then you should maybe propose they change that -- it's just the correct economics.

Growing up, my brother used to always get everything, whereas I never used to ask for anything. My brother weaseled his way out of having to pay for his car which my mum bought. He complained to my mum long enough about having to pay it back that my mum just gave in and let him have it.

On my birthday when I was little, I got a Gameboy Color, but because I wouldn't let him play on it whenever he wanted to, my mum ended up buying him one a few days later to shut him up.

Fast forwards a couple years later and I get a GBA for my birthday. Mum bought him one too...

I gave my mum a couple hundred of £ for Christmas, which she ended up giving to my brother because he was struggling, apparently.

He ended up in debt by over £8K and my parents were getting calls from debt collectors. Phoned up my parents crying saying he owed all this money. Guess who paid for it?

One time he had the cheek to ask me through my mum for £4K so he can get a car because he can't get any credit now... Ain't gonna happen.

Still salty about all this to this date.",1,0,12,12,,12,rageofa1000suns,cinderelliot,0

What is one thing Japanese people do right?,"So many things, I wish I could remember them all. We’ve visited twice, and I remember saying ‘why aren’t we doing this?!’ so many times. Public restrooms, especially public toilets, were just insane - bidets with a variety of settings, music to cover noises, etc. And quietness on subways - cell phone use is frowned upon.

Also, cheap eats! Tokyo gets a bad rep for being expensive- but honestly, it’s the plane tickets that are crazy, lodging and eating were quite reasonable. Yes, of course, you can eat very expensively, but the lower-cost options far outweigh America’s options, in both quality and quantity. And the konbinis (convenience stores) put ours to shame.

Edit: forgot to add, the museum prices! Although it was difficult to get tickets, we visited the Ghibli Museum both times - for about $8 total, family of 3. And the national museums were free or very low cost. Our nearby Children’s Museum in the states is about $18 per person.",4,0,8,8,,8,librarianjenn,BreadButterKnight,0

 Also, some of the most polite people. My last night in Japan I chose to stay in the cheapest hotel I could find near a train station in Osaka. This hotel ended up being in one of the roughest neighborhoods in Osaka. As I was walking around, some police cars were responding to some kind of emergency, and as they approached the intersection I was at, they were politely asking people to clear the intersection on their load speakers. Lights on, sirens blaring, and they still got on their loud speakers and said, ""Please move.""",2,0,8,8,,8,Ichooseyou_username,BreadButterKnight,0

I had an issue with a rental car company. I booked a car rental for a week, then told them before I picked up the car I wasn't going to need the car for as long, and the person at the rental place told me that was fine. When I arrived at my destination and turned in the car, they billed me for the entire week! The person at the counter told me it was their policy and they could do nothing. After getting nowhere trying to call them and get resolution; I jumped on Facebook and went directly to the rental car companies page. Complained (nicely) about my situation; and also sent the same verbiage to the 'messenger' link.  
I had an apology and refund within 24 hours :)

What do you believe is the difference between “masculinity” and “toxic masculinity”?,"I think there’s too many women with toxic masculinity.

Loud, aggressive, combative, argumentative, dominant, overly ambitious.

What do you believe is the difference between “masculinity” and “toxic masculinity”?,"To me ut sounds a lot like inclusion/exclusion. Toxic is a weird form of gatekeeping, an art of ""negging"" targeting men.

Toxic masculinity is that men should not be good listeners. Men should not not show, recognise or understand emotions. Toxic masculinity could also promote distancing one selves from women - they are different, they are neurotic, they are impossible to understand etc.

Masculinity is more about confidence, stability and strength, including certain traits without excluding or denying others.

OT: In my more funny social circles manly as also come to mean stupidity in a funny way - it's manly to never ask for directions. It's manly to attempt a new task even if you have no idea what you're doing, independence in an absurd way.",1,0,3,3,,3,asycla,AriValentina,0
What do you believe is the difference between “masculinity” and “toxic masculinity”?,"Random rules that have nothing to do with being male is toxic, like, what colors you're allowed to like(pink and now purple is forbidden), what foods or drinks you're allowed to like (like some people think drinking coffee that isn't black and bitter is feminine, or eating sweets is a girly thing to do). Beating each other up. Humiliating one another. Telling men they not supposed to cry. Insisting men can't be abused are all toxic. Pretty much, anything that puts men in a tiny cage that they're not allowed to move from without being punished is toxic. Masculinity itself is more of a physical trait, like being bulkier, taller, generally physically stronger, facial hair, is masculine. Not that all of those things are requirement.",1,0,3,3,,3,AnEven7,AriValentina,0

what's the funniest thing that happened during a war?,"The HMS Victoria, a battleship of the Royal Navy, began service in 1888 and was destined to be the flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet. Battleships, costing as much as £1.35 million apiece, were not something that Britain could spare. Despite this, they still managed to sink it, even without the help of the enemy. On June 22, 1893, Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon and the 10 battleships of the Mediterranean fleet were heading out to sea. Ordered into two columns, only 1,000 meters (3,300 ft) apart, the Vice Admiral decided to try something quite absurd.Wanting to put on a show, he ordered the two ships leading the column to turn 180 degrees toward each other and then continue forward to port, with the rest of the column repeating this move. The gap between the ships was far less than the turning circle for either battleship, something which Tryon had failed to calculate in his desire to take the lead in some synchronized sailing. The two insanely expensive battleships inevitably crashed, sinking the Victoria, which had only seen five years of service, and badly damaging the HMS Camperdown.

How many pillows do you sleep with and why?,"4 or 5. Haha. Side sleeper with minor scoliosis who’s suffered from insomnia and major back & hip pain. 

I’m a tall sprawler and like to sleep with arm(s) above head sometimes so usually one pillow against the headboard for my arm to rest on. One on top between arms and head and one to block out any sound and light if necessary/possible. Also one fat one to hug(friend of mine with horrible scoliosis suggested this and it changed my life) and one to keep my knees separated. 

Is there a pea under this mattress or something?

"Teachers, what differences do you notice about your students in the last 3 years?","Lecture here. I don't even know where to start. Some students consider my lectures to be optional, and are then surprised when they don't get good grades. Some think that they will get their degree because ""they paid for it"", and if they don't get their degree, they will ask for their money back. But I suppose the worst part is the lack of respect; arriving late as if nothing happened, eating in class, taking shoes off, and answering phone calls. If I did any one of those when I was a student, I'd have to pick up my head from the other side of the classroom.",1,0,3,3,,3,FragmentedC,ClydeCKO,0
"Teachers, what differences do you notice about your students in the last 3 years?","I'd say that there aren't a lot of differences. Kids are still kids, but there are a few tiny differences, mostly due to the pandemic. Taking health more seriously has become a little more normalized, even now in 2023. Many kids before 2020 would show up to school with wet coughs, runny noses, and sore throats, because they didn't want to have to miss school or thought their sickness ""wasn't serious enough"". I'd ask, ""Why are you here? You should go home!"" and they'd say, ""If I get marked absent again, I won't get to exempt any tests during the finals."" or, ""But then I'd miss a bunch of lessons and fall behind."" or, ""My mom won't let me.""

Now? I guess the attitude about showing up sick to school has changed. Not only is it a little more normalized to take care of yourself and take your health more seriously, but now it's almost seen as ""crazy"" to show up to school sick. When a kid shows up to school, kids are like, ""Dude, what if you have Covid? You're gonna make everyone sick!"" Lol

Also, there's the obvious stuff, like the TikTok craze, kids being more accepting of using ""they/them"" pronouns, kids being concerned about book bannings, some boys obsessing over Andrew Tate, etc.",1,0,3,3,,3,MeeMooHoo,ClydeCKO,0

The lobby was dingy and smelled musty, and the staff at the front desk seemed disinterested in helping me. They gave me my room key and told me to take the elevator up to my floor.  
  
When I got to my room, it was a disaster. The carpet was stained and sticky, and there was a strange odor in the air. The bed was lumpy and uncomfortable, and there were hairs on the sheets. The bathroom was worse - the toilet was dirty and the shower was clogged.  
  
I immediately went back down to the lobby to complain, but the staff was unresponsive. They told me that they were fully booked and there was nothing they could do. I was stuck in this awful hotel for the rest of my trip.  
  
To make matters worse, there was construction going on outside the hotel that started early in the morning and continued throughout the day. I couldn't sleep in or relax in my room. The noise was so loud that I had to leave the hotel during the day just to get some peace and quiet.  
  
The whole experience was a nightmare. I felt like I had wasted my money and my vacation time on this terrible hotel. I learned my lesson - I would never book a hotel without thoroughly researching it and reading reviews from other travelers first.",1,0,2,2,,2,R1xelf,lakersmike,0

Mario Maker is close to the ideal format because you can use the new abilities but the levels can get as difficult as you want, *but* the fact that they're just isolated levels and the coins/lives/points don't carry over makes it harder to play as an actual continuous game.",2,0,2,2,,2,VarangianDreams,JoseanGames,0

What dark family secret did you learn recently?,"My uncle was a serial killer.

My uncle, mom's brother, had been responsible for a bunch of prostitutes that were murdered in Austin and San Antonio, Texas in the 90s. Until then I didn't even know I had an uncle. My mom never mentioned him. Her and my aunt acted like he didn't even exist. Looking back it is kind of weird how many childhood photos I saw or my dad's family but never my moms. Their maiden name is fairly unique. I was just googling all of our names, as kids do, and I saw an uncle on the list of siblings for my mom. I pointed it out to her. She just shrugged and brushed it off. I did more digging and found public arrest records in Texas. 

A few years later when I was in college a few of us were going down to Austin. I thought it would be a good time to maybe even talk to this long lost uncle. I remember going to the prison. It was the most unnerving experience. Just the amount of strictness combined with that mundaneness of the grey walls and flourescent lighting. He sat down and he looked so much like my mom it was astonishing. I introduced myself and who I was. You could see him getting emotional. It was the first contact he'd had with family in years. He tried to talk. Through his voice breaking he only said one thing to me. I barely even heard it but he whispered ""Don't believe everything you read on Reddit.""",4,0,3,3,,3,PhreedomPhighter,Pandepon,0

"Nice people of Reddit, when was the time you lost your absolute shit at someone?","Roughly 1 year ago my best friend and I wanted to go have dinner at a restaurant. It was shortly before the Covid restrictions were lifted in our country. At the time, you still had to provide proof that you're vaccinated if you wanted to enter a bar, coffee shop or restaurant. The way we had to prove this was by scanning a QR code in an app which our government created. So, every vaccinated person had this app on their phone.

For regular people, the scanning process wasn't a big deal; it took just a second or two. However, I'm (nearly) blind. Due to my disability, I've got various accessibility settings turned on on my iPhone. For example all the colors are switched around and the font is bigger etc.. Due to these settings, a lot of the scanners struggled to recognize the QR code on my screen. Sometimes I had to scan it 3 or 4 times and many times it didn't work at all. Some people realized this and usually just waved me through after checking my app manually. For example the security staff at the hospital usually just had a looked at my phone and then said: ""It's fine, you can enter.""

But the waiter at this one restaurant simply refused to have even the tiniest bit of empathy and common sense. He made me scan my phone over and over and over again even though there were a lot of people waiting. My friend and I had made a reservation and we had been wanting to eat at this restaurant for a long time, so we didn't want to just walk away. The waiter just kept shaking his head and saying: ""Nah dude, it's not working. Sorry. You can't enter."" I told him multiple times to check my app manually but he refused to do so. He kept saying: ""That's not allowed. You have to scan it, that's the law."" I told him that many other people (such as the hospital staff) also check it manually but he just said: ""I don't care, it's the law. We gotta scan it."" The whole situation was incredibly frustrating and I felt super discriminated against. The guy kept telling me to ""change my phone"" so that the scanner could read the code. I tried to explain to him that that's not possible. My settings are very carefully calibrated and it would've taken too long to put everything back to zero. Also, it would've taken me forever to find the same settings again. I don't want to sit at home afterwards working on this for 1-2 hours just because some guy was being a total pain in the ass.

The whole talk went on for a long time and I really showed a lot of patience but this blatant form of ableism just really fucked me up emotionally. So at one point I lost my temper and I started yelling at the guy. I held my white cane right in his dumb face and screamed that I'm fucking blind and how hard is it to understand that.

Unfortunately, even that didn't help. In the end, my friend and I had to walk away and eat dinner somewhere else. The worst part was that after we left the restaurant, instead of saying something like: ""what a fucking jackass"", my friend said to me: ""You shouldn't have yelled at him, that wasn't polite of you."" At that point I nearly began to cry. I swear to God, able-bodied people have no idea how hard it is to be disabled.",1,0,2,2,,2,Arcane-Panacea,reflec_tion,0

Know what products or services the company sells and show a passion for it.

Know the history of said company. Doesn't need to be a history lesson, but it will show you have put the effort in.

If you are asked about a scenario in which you are lacking experience, don't be afraid to tell them that, but tell them what you would do on given scenario.

Have an idea of what the job requires and why you think you will be good at it.

If you are applying for retail or any customer facing environment, think of what good and bad service looks like and try to put yourself in the customers shoes.

I've done interviews for many people and the biggest annoyances are having people who walk in the door having no idea what they will be doing, know nothing about us, what we stand for or the services we sell.",1,0,3,3,,3,rageofa1000suns,AnaitisMoka,0
What are your best first job/interview tips for teens?,"Most interview questions boil down to:
#1 Do you give a shit about this job? 
#2 Why should I give a shit about you specifically?
Selling yourself is important - showing up, clean appearance, good handshake etc. A lot of interviewers ask about your strengths, weaknesses, how you resolve conflict, etc so it helps to have some idea of what you wanna say beforehand. But that all falls under #2 category 
The #1 category is you showing that you’ve looked into this business and you know what they’re about. They may straight up ask you why you want to work there, and saying more than what essentially adds up to “I just need a job” can make a huge difference. Look at the business’ website or social media to see what they may be promoting or working on. Stuff like that. Shows that you are prepared and that you do in fact, give a shit",1,0,3,3,,3,TacticalShimmy,AnaitisMoka,0

2. Guster has been releasing music since the 90s and has never put out a bad album. Their most recent album is quite a bit different from their earlier stuff, but experiments in very satisfying ways.

3. In my opinion the second half of Tom Waits' entire discography is even more interesting and intriguing (though maybe not always as listenable) as the first half, and this goes all the way through to his last album in 2012.

I feel like people who have ""skin in the game"" should be the only ones voting.  How do we determine who that is?  I'm not sure and I think it would be rife with corruption so I don't think actually trying to limit voting would be a good idea.

On the other hand, there's a lot of research about the wisdom of the crowd.  I studied a lot of statistics, and basically the bigger a sample size gets the more likely there is to be a true bell curve.  The middle of the curve is usually the answer you're looking for.  So, if more and more people are asked, eventually your average will be fairly close to accurate.  I have no idea how to put this into practice directly, either.

What I am sure of is that right now we have a tyrannical binary in the US where the majority (by only 1 vote) can basically rule over the minority.  I don't know the right answer on how to fix this, because the current alternatives are all even more flawed, but it's led to some pretty terrible outcomes and basically taken us to the very polarized state we currently live in.",14,0,1086,1086,,1086,booknerd381,Pennameus_The_Mighty,0

The answer is universal education. A healthy democracy absolutely requires a robust system of education for the voting population. This is something I don't believe the ancient Greeks had to the level we do. Look at literacy rates for men and women in most democratic countries.

Just randomly picking for someone because you can isn't voting.

Voting has responsibility attached to it, knowing who stands for what, and understanding the issues and repercussions of the choices that are made. 

Who does it affect? Who's going to be giving something up and why? Because someone always loses something.

But then again, as a basis of our fundamental freedoms everyone, 

Let's say that again, Everyone has the right to vote under our constitution and therefore everyone should have the right to vote unencumbered, and their rights should be defended.

[Serious] Socrates famously criticized democracy and said that (paraphrasing) only people educated on the issues being voted on should be allowed to vote and that universal enfranchisement would be a mistake. How do you feel about this idea?,"There are a couple of different ways to interpret this:

1. Having an informed opinion is essential to a healthy democracy
2. Disengaged and idiotic opinions create stupid decisions
3. Educated = wealthy, and we can't allow poor people and women the vote or we'll lose our position of influence

&#x200B;

The third one is obviously wrong to believe for a variety of reasons so I won't get into it here.

&#x200B;

I can't agree more with (1) that being informed makes for a healthy democracy but he's taking this from the wrong end of the problem. It's immediately going to cause problems to have (2) because we're going to have a raff of stupid policies and easily mislead people. Anti-intellectuals and conservatives are going to create narratives that make tyranny way, way easier to control others and make them vote against their own interests.

&#x200B;

The key here is not to disenfranchise blocs of voters but to make education mandatory. You get to vote no matter what, but you must also go to school and learn about this issues.

How do you feel about this idea?,"In addition the other good points, consider this: what is society?

The morals and conventions that each of us individually encounter are _themselves_ created from the people around us. When enough people think something ought to be “the way things are,” then that something becomes “the way things are” basically by definition. 

When pointing to an example of “the way things are,” you’d most commonly think of the legal code or government regulations. Look at gay marriage, crime & punishment, employment regulations. 

But society’s votes are another example. The way people vote says something about how they want the world to be, or how they want to address the failings of the world, or what appeals to them in the world as it stands. 

Unrestricted voting is a mechanism by which society can more accurately and quickly change to a “way things are” that society _wants_. Restricted voting won’t stop that process, but it will slow it down and explore the wrong paths.

My problem with Socrates’ opinion is that he didn’t understand the true extent of a “society.” He thought groups could isolate…but they can’t actually. There aren’t even “groups,” really. It is individuals—_all_ individuals—forming conflicting or cooperative consensuses, so the best we can do is something those individuals broadly agree on.

They ruled for 8 months, and killed around 5% of Athenian population. Let that sink in... Critias is called the first Robespierre. Now, the comparison is not entirely fair, as Athenes have lost the war to Sparta, and it was Sparta who installed the 30 tyrants to rule, but it is still very close.

Or for more recent examples, check out the last dictator of Romania and his wife. They knew what's the best for the country, with devastating effects for everyone involved.

Meanwhile, what he does argue for is that - rather than what is required for the above mentioned system, that people have gold, silver and bronze souls, etc. - all practical people should be a bit more philosophical, and vice versa, and that the ultimate victory would happen were the leaders to be convinced that they should all become philosophers (rather than just peddling in the facade of ""democracy"", of doing popular things that seemingly people would like). Similarly, he argues very openly for that even the least political person in Athens should still have something to offer when joining in debates about how the city should be run.

So Socrates argues for not just suffrage, but that everyone should actually participate in the running of the city.

Which was clearly too controversial for the ones who wrote the teaching books in philosophy in the 1910s, 30s and 60s.",1,0,1086,1086,,1086,nipsen,Pennameus_The_Mighty,0

[Serious] Socrates famously criticized democracy and said that (paraphrasing) only people educated on the issues being voted on should be allowed to vote and that universal enfranchisement would be a mistake. How do you feel about this idea?,"I'm not about to disagree with Socrates, but I think in a world where the vast majority are not thoroughly educated, it seems like making everyone that much smarter/learned/informed is a good idea....and it is , for economic reasons a great idea.

Education, sadly , only confers training, knowledge and the mechanistic understanding of the various complexities of our civilization...farming, medicing, engineering, computer science etc. 

But we're inferring here something it MOST DEFINITELY does not provide. Provide a moral compass. Sure, the Hypocritic Oath ensures doctors are not , by default sadistic to their patients, and engineers have codes of conduct for buildings and standards, but when it comes to ethics, education can inform you of the great ethical thinkers and perhaps religious perspectives, but it doesn't inform as to how to actually **be** moral. 

Some folks might run to organized Religion , but is that really what organized religion is most notably used for these days. Sure ""back in the day"" it was used to give children a moral framework, now pretty much it's been morphed from a pro-social conception invented to give exactly this moral compass and turned into a highly effective grift , extracting money/time/resources from ""the faithful"" usually to the enrichment of pastor Bob or such.

Worse is that by way of mistaking or conflating ""faith"" as someone one should reserve for the great mysteries of existence , we're asked to take it on faith, that pastor Bob is not engaging in this or that abuse of children.....which is a problem. This is what totalitarianism does, whether elected or by coming to power through violence, it engages in ""faith based"" government, that ""the guy in charge"" is looking out for me. This may or may not be true of god, and is almost certainly not the case of some dictator. 

So Socrates is right, Democracy can lead to a bad end when easily duped people are left to vote, but he's a bit wrong when he suggests making people ""smarter"" is the solution, it's not even making people more ""religious"" it's making people more ethical and/or civically minded as well as informed.",1,0,1086,1086,,1086,markth_wi,Pennameus_The_Mighty,0
[Serious] Socrates famously criticized democracy and said that (paraphrasing) only people educated on the issues being voted on should be allowed to vote and that universal enfranchisement would be a mistake. How do you feel about this idea?,"This is just the argument that coincides with the often referred joke about democracy ""so everyone gets to vote? Even the dumb ones??""

It's not an invalid argument. Common sense imo tells you that the ignorance of people and identity politics filled with personal emotions (left wing vs right wing) likely causes voting to not result in the best outcome for getting actual solutions to real issues and the overall advancement of society 

** holy fucking run on sentence **

The obvious question like everyone is saying is how to determine who has the amount of ""knowledge"" needed to vote and who doesn't. The solutions presented like every other issue will be met with fierce political/social discourse 

The only solution I could think of is have independent academic scholars formulate standardized tests on 10 major current political/social issues and general topics; i.e. climate change, gun violence/gun rights, world diplomacy, economics, political law, poverty/hunger crisis, immigration, etc.

If you want to vote in the election you have to participate in the testing 

Make 10 tests. Keep it simple, multiple choice, maybe 50 or 100 questions, pass or fail scoring. To pass you need a score of 80% or higher, no curve, all questions count as one point. Same questions given to everyone. No time limit 

Precisely a year prior to voting day topics are voted on and announced. Six months later the scholars release a synopsis of each test with suggested specific areas/sub-topics to focus on

To vote you have need to pass three tests. You allowed to take all 10 tests but only get one attempt for each. If you only take three tests and pass each you get to vote. If you take all 10 tests fail seven times and pass three you get to vote. However, if you get 50% or less even just one test you lose your vote that election, regardless of how many others you passed

15 weeks prior to voting day the testing starts. One topic per week. Tests are in person at voting facilities. Each person gets Monday - Sunday to make arrangements if they want to take the test that week. Testing is open/available from 6:00am to midnight each day

Tests are scanned and your percentage score is given immediately but no specific answers. The answer keys will be released after all 10 tests are administered. Your given official proof of pass/fail results for each test you take and you have to bring all of them with you when you vote. You also bring them back each time you take a test so that if you get less than 50% your other proof of testing can be stamped as void. You get proof marked ""Not Administered"" for the tests you choose not to take 

** curveball **

If you take/pass all 10 tests and get a score of 90% or higher on five of them then your vote in the election doubles and will count as two votes. If you take/pass all 10 tests and get a score of 95% or higher on five of them then your vote triples and counts as three votes

If you score 90% or higher on all 10 tests then your vote counts as four. If you score 95% or higher on all 10 tests then your vote counts as five

Get 100% on all 10 tests then your vote counts as 10

Prior to voting booths opening tally the number of people eligible to vote and their individual vote counts and announce the figure of available votes for that election. Precise popular vote wins. The candidate that gets 50.01% of the available votes is elected 

^ that would be complicated to implement but would give incentive for people to educate themselves across a wide spectrum of issues, not just the ones they give a fuck about

Economists are probably a good example for why we shouldn’t limit voting based on education.

Worse, it's a arbitrary descision of where you draw the line. How much do you have to know to be considered ""knowledgeable enough"". So those in power just make sure enough or as few are counted as needed.

It's one directional. A ruling elite who ""know enough"" to make the laws will assuredly never rule that it was a silly idea and give up that power.

And it's prone to abuse. If they can decide constitutes being an expert on a topic, they'll make sure the criteria fits their friends and family. Because we've ALREADY BEEN HERE. It's a ruling class of nobility. Been there, tried that. It was horrific.

And of course this is only supported by those people that think they know enough to count. The quickest way to defuse this bullshit idea is to point out a slew of topics they're not experts in and how they must be okay with giving up any say in how it's handled: taxation, healthcare, fitness, war, pollution, land use.

1) Who decides who is educated enough on a topic to vote? This could very easily lead to one of two things. 

Either someone bending what makes someone educated enough on a topic so only those that support their view are considered educated enough

or if a standard is somehow established, then preventing knowledge of the topic from getting widespread so only a small amount of people are allowed to vote on it.

As it currently stands, people already do take advantage of keeping people uniformed on critical voting topics, so neither of those two things are really too far fetched assumptions

Even so, none of them could answer Socrates' question of what justice is. No one ever has come up with a definitive answer - except perhaps John Rawls, two millennia later.

It may be that a definitive answer does not exist, perhaps because we have competing intuitions on justice which cannot be fully reconciled; or that, if there is an answer, we cannot comprehend it because of some limitations built in to the structure of the human intellect; or that the 'skill' needed to judge matters of politics or justice is simply not analogous to any of the technical skills Socrates brought up such as shoemaking or pottery. This last appears to be common sense.

So who should have the vote? If we are all equally unqualified, then no one should. This looks like an argument against democracy, but it means kings or oligarchs are no more qualified than anyone else to make political decisions, so they shouldn't rule either. And this brings us to anarchy, which brings us indirectly back round to democracy, because voting is a way for individuals who freely associate with each other to make collective decisions. Equally unqualified comes to the same thing as equally qualified: ergo, we should all get a vote.

Plato, of course, disagreed. He readily saw that most people were unqualified to make political decisions, yet believed a small minority were: philosophers such as himself. Philosophers, however, are no more capable of saying what justice means than anyone else, despite endless attempts to do so, so why should they rule? Plato did attempt to say what justice means, and his answer was along the lines of 'justice exists in a state when philosophers are in charge of it, so now I've explained what justice is so I should be in charge'. Loosely paraphrased.

What people in the 21st century need to understand is that capitalism is only compatible with pseudo-democracy, not genuine democracy.  

When all of the major economic and productive decisions are made by a tiny ruling class of capitalists, they will inevitably make the decisions that benefit themselves at everyone else's expense and turn the public into mis-educated serfs/slaves working for their own power and profits.  

That's the current condition of the US, where 10% of the people own 90% of the wealth, and the vast majority of people have been turned into wildly ignorant and mis-educated serfs/slaves working for the profits of an extremely abusive ruling class.

So to answer your question, yes, people do need to be well-educated to participate productively in a genuinely democratic society.

However, an actually well-educated public (and not deliberately mis-educated serfs/slaves) wouldn't tolerate the capitalist system (and the pseudo-democracy it entails) for long. 

So we instead have both an ignorant and mis-educated public, and a corrupt pseudo-democracy, with the public utterly dominated and controlled by an extremely abusive ruling capitalist class.",1,0,1086,1086,,1086,xena_lawless,Pennameus_The_Mighty,0

So we either need to bridge the knowledge gap, so that everyone has a good idea of how best to solve their problems without making others worse off, or have a technocratic elite that are going to faithfully serve the best interests of the people.

Representative Democracy is an attempt to have the best of both worlds. The people vote in experts based on what issues they promise to fix and those representatives take the time to really understand the various solutions and pick the best one.

What are two contradicting opinions where you agree with both of them?,"How about two that I don't agree with?

""Guns don't kill people, people kill people.""

""Guns save lives.""

If guns don't kill people (because the implication is that it's the person using the gun), then guns don't save lives because by the same logic, it's the person using the gun that is saving lives.

But if guns save lives (regardless of the person using it), then guns kill people.

&#x200B;

I won't deny that it's the person using a gun that is the sentient killer, but using a gun is the most popular choice because of how effective it is.  So a gun being used to kill someone means that a gun was partially responsible.  So, people use guns to kill people.  Thus, there needs to be rules/laws in place to protect people by limiting who can own guns, so that those who are least likely to misuse a gun (or use it to commit a crime) are able to own them, while those who are identified as being incapable of being a responsible gun owner should either be denied, or have to take extra steps to show that they would actually be a responsible gun owner.

Heck, even responsible gun owners can make mistakes that results in a tragedy, but I'm not in favor of outright banning guns because of it.  Look at the situation where a 6 yr old killed a teacher at school.  Very terrible situation.  Yes, something needs to be done to try to prevent it from ever happening again, such as the owner of the gun used losing their rights to own any guns.  But it doesn't mean that guns should be outlawed.  But guns used in mass shootings where the person doing the shooting owns the guns but should never have had access to guns?  Yeah, we need laws to keep people like that from getting guns, while not affecting others.",1,0,389,389,,389,Fangs_McWolf,Macaroon_Low,0

What are two contradicting opinions where you agree with both of them?,"The existence and value of a god, its religion and the divine.

Without it, those who bring the most results are totally justified and morally right; this is because you can define it, and what better way is there to pen the rules other than possessing a lot of power.

Thus, evil is rewarded, power is celebrated, and the upstarts should be kept in control.

The existence of a god undermines the human concept and ability of defining morality for themselves, bringing a baseline stability and providing an incentive for the naturally-greedy human ego to forego earthly materialism in favor of a reward in the afterlife.

Yet, with how religion is today, the concept itself is distorted, waved as a flag for ulterior motives, and we go back to square one asking if the greater divinity exists?

- Why has he not resolved most conflicts?
- Why must there be needless slaughter?
- Why do people pretend it necessary for deaths or loss to occur for repentance (as in the changing of minds) to happen?

Thus, despite being raised religious, I cannot fault nor blame people for their dislike of the topic, and in fact I sympathize with them.

If I think solely with my personal emotions, abortion is wrong and horrible and sad. 
If I think with logic and science, it’s purely a medical procedure. On top of that, the government & society has absolutely NO business or right to tell anyone ever what they can and cannot do within a medical facility with a medical professional. 
I could go on and on with this topic. Overall I lean more on pro choice side, I think it is just truly horrible that as a society we place all the weight on women’s shoulders for this. From accidental pregnancies, to rape, to situations with domestic violence or extreme poverty, all of this could be handled in a much better way if birth control was easier to access for more people, and sex ed was a higher priority, and rape was taken more seriously. 

Plus on top of that, even with birth control, pregnancy is 40 weeks. That’s a long time to be pregnant if you don’t want to be. Some women don’t want babies anyway, and no birth control is 100%. 

I’ll stop there but I could absolutely go on all day on the back and forth in my head. It boils down to the fact that it’s none of my business what other people do, though. Whether or not I would agree with what they decide.",1,0,389,389,,389,Macaroon-Melody,Macaroon_Low,0

These innovations often have knock-on effects that amplify this good; for example, the pressure that Tesla put on the automotive industry re electric cars, led to diversification of the supply chain for EV's, and now the demand for infrastructure is spurring new innovations (see methane trapping over landfills now being used as fuel to charge electric cars).

"Backstreet Boys or NSYNC. Reddit, who is the better Boy Band?","\*N Sync:

They received less support because BSB always was the company's prority. This is how they basically started in Europe instead of the USA. In the end, they survived Lou Pearlman.

They were better dancers. The choreography for ""Bye bye bye"" is still popular and even was in the standup routine for ""Evolution of dance"" which became one of Youtube's first meme videos.

They were on ""The Simpsons"" and at the Super Bowl, twice.

I personally understand the hype about Justin Timberlake but JC Chasez is maybe even the better singer. Chris Kirkpatrick and Lance Bass also had interesting voices, one very high and the other very low which was not so typical for BSB.

In my opinion BSB's popularity was more based on their looks. \*N Sync did not have members of the same ""hotness level"", some were obviously favoured a lot.

"Backstreet Boys or NSYNC. Reddit, who is the better Boy Band?","Let’s check the tale of the tape. 

Leads: 
*NSYNC - Justin and JC
BSB - Nick and Brian

Gotta give an edge to *NSYNC here. Justin easily the biggest star of everyone, and JC was the whole package too. BSB leads were great but not at that level. 

Advantage: *NSYNC

High Tenors:
*NSYNC - Chris
BSB - Howie

Howie gets the nod here. They both have strong countertenor voices, but Chris was relatively considerably older than the rest of the group. 

Advantage: BSB

The Goatees:

NSYNC - Joey
BSB - AJ

Voice wise, it isn’t even close. AJ all Day. Add to that, he’s an actual “bad boy” and sang lead on many of the songs. I couldn’t pick Joey’s voice out of a lineup. Has a great personality though. 

Advantage: BSB

The bass/baritones

NSYNC - Lance
BSB - Kevin

I mean, the man’s actual name is BASS (I know. Different pronunciation) for god’s sake. Solid singer but admittedly not the best dancer. Kevin is basically just there to have the group add up to five members. Extra point for an insane jawline. 

Advantage: NSYNC

Song Catalog: the hits 

NSYNC - 1 number one hit
BSB - None

Legacy:

NSYNC - Justin’s shadow
BSB - Still touring and killing it. 

Final Call: Given that BSB is still touring and somehow selling records, and the fact that one of them is from my hometown and another is a huge UK football fan, the edge has got to go to BSB.",2,0,65,65,,65,funkycat75,Adventure84,0

Clams get shipped to the restaurant in bushels packed in flat mud.  Before you can steam them (for New England style, ""Steam-ahs""), they need to be cleaned of mud and scooped into to a net basket.

The worst part was during the green head season ([https://newengland.com/yankee-magazine/living/pests/greenheads/](https://newengland.com/yankee-magazine/living/pests/greenheads/)) when the small ""clam shack"" used for washing clams became a ""greenhead trap"".

We all told stories of the usual work shit shows and it was all pretty typical. It’d been going on for some time until this one guy, Brett says “ the worse job I had was one I worked one day only.  It was for a biohazard cleanup company. You know, clean ups in homes after someone dies.”  

The place is quiet now, just wind howling and the sounds of folks shifting in their gear.

He sighs and continues, “so my very first day, I walk onto the job site where a lady had done herself in by shotgun to the face. I immediately slip and fall flat out on my back.  I scramble to my feet completely freaked out.  I probably could have stayed on the job but I looked down and realized what I’d slipped on was a piece of her *jaw*.  I left and never went back.”

What is your main communication style? Ask Culture or Guess Culture?,"Ask culture- assertive. You directly ask and inquire about things. You appreciate being upfront, honest, and open. You'll ask questions to gain clarity rather than assume things. 

Guess culture- you tend to assume others know what you want or can read your nonverbal cues. You take others questions as assumptions (so like if someone asks if they can room with you for a few days, you assume they're expecting you to say yes). Can be passive aggressive. non assertive. Involves a lot of avoidance

Many people fall into both. In America is especially common for people to fall into guess culture which can be actually very damaging at times. In some places guess culture can even go as far as people assuming if you say ""hey I like your necklace"" or something like that, that the other person has ulterior motives or wants you to give them something",0,0,2,2,,2,ThrowRAnadanada,ThrowRAnadanada,0

"If you woke up one day and you were 40, no career, no savings, no degree, no real skills and a decent amount of debt and had to make it at that age, what would you do?",I'd be thankful I was 10 years younger,4499,0,2712,2712,,2712,PhD147,Aarunascut,0
"If you woke up one day and you were 40, no career, no savings, no degree, no real skills and a decent amount of debt and had to make it at that age, what would you do?","That was pretty much me. I was a stay at home mom while raising my children. I got divorced in my 40s. No work history for about 15 years, didn’t know anything about computers. We’d been living in a rented house and the car I drove was leased. I was also left with full care of our four children and about $40,000 in credit card debt.


I went back to school and got a paralegal certificate. I turned in the leased car and bought an older car with more than 80,000 miles already on it. I went to a temporary agency and they taught me enough computer basics to get some jobs (I was an excellent typist which helped).

I started working full time as a bankruptcy associate but the company moved far enough that I had almost three hours of commuting each day. So when I saw an ad for a deputy court administrator about ten miles from me, I applied and got the job. 

Five years later I became a court administrator. I moved to a bigger court with a 33% increase in salary. In the meantime, I’d bought my own house and met and married a wonderful man. 

I retired two years ago after the better part of 20 years in the court system at a salary of $75,000. I
never thought I’d get so far or accomplish so much.

An edit for the doubters. I got divorced in 1997. At the time my children were 9, 12, 15 and 18. Old enough for me to be able to leave them for night classes. It was in 1995 that I started taking classes. I think it was 1998 that I got a paralegal certificate. I continued in to an associates degree but that took considerably longer. I think it was around 2004 when I finished. 

As for how did I afford it, my marriage ended with an episode of domestic violence which is what spurred me on to change my life. My ex husband moved out in 1994; our divorce was finalized in
1997. There was a local program I found affiliated with our community college that was geared to people who found themselves, whether by divorce, illness, disability, etc., needing to earn an income. It was called Transitions. I enrolled and took a free career test. There were a number of possibilities but the paralegal program worked for me because it could be completed in a relatively short period of time. Most of the time I took two classes at at time since I was working during the day, first part time and then full time. And let’s not forget about those four kids. 

Anyway through Transitions I also qualified for a grant that not only covered school expenses, but usually had a little left at the end of each semester. 

One commenter questioned my age. They decided I must be at least 60 and wanted to know why I was on Reddit. I didn’t know there was an upper age limit!  As a matter of fact, I turn 72 next month. If that somehow offends people, that’s your problem, not mine. 

I respond more often than I post but I always respond honestly. None of it was easy. One semester I was so worn down that one night I came home from night classes after working all day. I went in my bedroom to get dressed for bed. My middle daughter came down the hall to find me kneeling at the side of my bed, head on the bed, totally naked and sound asleep. I went to my doctor and got a medical note to drop all my classes that semester. 

I am proud of what I accomplished and my kids have all told me they were proud of me too. I’m giving further details after reading some comments, but keep in mind I’m summarizing about 25 years of my life. Again, looking back, I don’t really know how I got through but I did. 

And I’m happily remarried. My ex was engaged before the divorce and has never really been happy. I don’t mind that at all!",2240,0,2712,2712,,2712,awakeagain2,Aarunascut,0

One of my old buddies became certified in a CAD program (Computer Aided Design) at a university. He used it to get a job at a major aircraft company for $60k/yr. Guess what? He was 45 when he did it, AND was released from prison only two years prior for a buncha bad stuff he did when he was younger. So that dude had a STEEP uphill climb.

"If you woke up one day and you were 40, no career, no savings, no degree, no real skills and a decent amount of debt and had to make it at that age, what would you do?","I wasn't forty but this was me at almost 30 after getting laid off from a job. My choice was to find another shit job or do something drastic. I chose drastic. Since I already had some debt I figured what was a bit more and went to college. I made sure I chose a degree that would all but guarantee a decent paying job if I were half decent, computer science. I worked part time jobs and supplemented with loans. Terrible terrible idea I know. But I graduated in 2.5 years, got that decent, very decent, paying job, paid off my debt in 5 years (almost 65k) and now live very comfortably. Best decision I ever made.
  
The debt was high because I paid out of state tuition for a year and summer school every year which costs way more than a regular semester.
  
You can do this with far far less debt through community college and not living off loans like I did. But only do this with a degree program that has jobs in the field, programming and IT for example.

Electrician is probably the easiest in my opinion, but also one of the more dangerous if you aren't careful. Getting in with a good plumbing outfit that does higher end stuff is also good in my experience, but I may be a little biased as that's what my plumbing company does. 

Journeymen make decent money, but you can also get your Masters license (just passing a test, no additional education needed) and get a pretty hefty pay bump. To give you some ideas: I pay my newest journeyman about $25/hr, and my journeyman who's been here the longest makes about $30/hr. My newest master makes about $50/hr, and my longest working one makes about $70/hr. The trades are very easy to get into, and if you want, start your own business to make even more money.

He was working on minimum wage and being exploited, he failed college, and now this happening, the used his last savings to become an ilegal immigrant and chase the american dream, but it turns out, he was caught in mexico and deported. He again was here and asked relatives help who provided some money to go to spain. In spain he filed for asylum for death threats, and he became a refugee under government watch, who provided food and shelter, after 2 years his case resolved in his favor and the government granted a work permit, then, he became a truck driver with no real skills other than knowing how to drive a car. It turns out, in europe, unlike the US, give you many social benefits for paying taxes,so he had access to healthcare, a job office, some food stamps and some help to get some affordable housing, so after 2 years he got back on his feet. He married at age 43 and had a kid who most likely will have educational benefits from the european government. I'm happy he's living a decent life after being in a tough situation most of his live.

"If you woke up one day and you were 40, no career, no savings, no degree, no real skills and a decent amount of debt and had to make it at that age, what would you do?","This question is harder to answer than it appears at first. If I very strictly stick with the rules of your hypothetical - I spent a good amount of time thinking about it and all my solutions had dead ends. For sake of argument I will assume bad credit is part of the situation as well. I was even contemplating an identity change to avoid the debt. Good luck paying for that on min wage. Also even with a clean slate; would you be able to get an apartment with no previous credit or renters history? And could you even afford it on the minimum wage jobs you'd need to take? I thought about - ok I would be single with no kids, so go do something adventurous like living semi off grid in Alaska. But that probably requires a lot of seed money to get started. You need a fair amount of gear and supplies, and a plane ticket and more transportation later as well. 
Also it's difficult to mentally separate oneself from the skills you have. I've been in IT/software development/management since 1997. Those skills run deep in my persona at this point. My level of problem solving, soft people skills, and obviously knowledge of technology in 1996 are hard to even remember anymore, but they sure as shit were limited. 

I guess in short; I'm already in my late 40's. If I got transplanted into that situation I would not have the fight left in me to play the ""game of life"" all over again. I would attempt to bail on my debts and find a non-typical (to Americana) lifestyle. Something off grid or off-the-land type of living situation and just accept that as old age came and health declined I would not receive advanced medical care.

But that's just me personally in this very unrealistic hypothetical. For OP, I agree with others, trade school, truck driver, or play your cards right in a college situation; take as much Jr college hours as possible with federal grants/loans. Go to a state university for a computer science degree. Get a software related job. In 10 years I bet you'll be in a very different situation.

"If you woke up one day and you were 40, no career, no savings, no degree, no real skills and a decent amount of debt and had to make it at that age, what would you do?","This was not exactly me, but close enough just a few years ago. Let me preface this by saying I do not have a high salary. However, I do have a few advantages so far as location and home equity with a spouse.

Learn what you can about money. Read books, take courses. Get a skill doing something. There's a lot of credentials that don't take a lot of money, or are close to free. I used lockdown to better myself. 

First, I got rid of revolving debt. That gave me and extra 200 bucks per month to invest.

Second, I went back to my dusty IRA and maxed it out every year. This will be my 4th year doing that. Even with the market down, I am doing okay.  I took the 200 bucks per month from credit card interest to put in a dividend focused brokerage account and Series I and EE bonds. In 20-ish years, the goal is 1000 bucks per month from the dividend and bond accounts. To be fair, I supplement the dividend and bond accounts with every stray penny like tax refunds, etc.

Third, after getting my house in order, I bought a small rental property and am saving up for another, with plans for a total of 3 in 10 years. Again, the goal is to clear 1000 bucks per month in 20 years.

The distance between now and 5 years ago is vast. What counted is every day I did something toward my goal being able to have a vision of retiring at 60, or having a vision of what that retirement will look like.

Optimise where you can: I itemize the hell out of my returns and keep my taxable income low (one of the reasons I bout the rental was that depreciation would keep my AGI permanently negative) to keep the student loan people at bay. In addition to my actual work, I work at a part-time job in the public sector job that qualifies for PSLF.

Lean on family/friends to live with for a couple years while doing so.  If you are advancing yourself most people are willing to help.  Work part time to cover other expenses.

Once I have my two year degree put out applications like crazy and find that first job.  Apply for any business hiring in that field and don't be picky.  That first job no matter how shitty is what gets you the experience to get the next job that is better pay, location, and such.

I made the shortsighted decision 2 years ago to enroll in an MPH program. About a year later, I was having doubts about it and decided to take a leave of absence. It's been a year now since I started my leave and I have no desire to continue given the debt I've accrued and the pay that most starting positions in my field would ostensibly offer (assuming I completed said MPH). I've fallen into a pretty deep depression and still have no motivation or idea to better myself right now. I'm not quite sure what to do at the moment but I applied to a cheaper in-state MPH program, which I doubt will lead anywhere. If I'm still in this predicament by the time I'm 40, I'll probably put a bullet in my head in all honesty. I've tried therapy to try to find myself some emotional stability, but I've certainly hit rock bottom at this point in my life.",2,0,2712,2712,,2712,SirBeardsAlot91,Aarunascut,0

I would find a job doing anything just to get income coming in ASAP. I would then try to find room to rent or roommate within walking distance of my job so my housing and transportation is cheap enough to save up some money. 

I would call all of the people I had debt to and get some payments delayed or work out payment plans with cheaper payments

I would try to get some food assistance temporarily until I turned things around a little more

I would look to upgrade my job or start at the bottom some place where I could learn skills in order to make more money in the future. 

I would chisel away at my debt the best I could and then get a prepaid credit card to help get my credit score back in a good range.

"Considering the past 50 years of technological invention and innovation, what do you expect from the next 50 years?","I work in embedded electronics at the silicon level. Every day you probably touch 1,000,000+ products my company has made. If you are touching an electronic or smart device, it probably has our silicon in it somewhere. 

We are on the razor's edge of having AI building components and AI in embedded components. Nvidia's Tensor Cores is a start on that path, but I think we're getting close to a point where you're going to see the actual motherboard have AI in it to optimize data paths for certain data and then embedded IoT with AI chips that support specific functions. 

We really need consumer rights on data faster than we're getting. I think we're getting close to a tipping point where AI is going to know a dangerous amount about us to the point that your individual lifestyle choices become something to buy. 

Already, just from your phone's accelerometer, we can tell how you drive, if you are injured, overweight, or drunk. We wrote software one time (using only the acceleromoter data) that made a gait fingerprint and we could identify who held the phone based on their unique gate. It was 100% after a mile no matter who we tried. 

If I can tell how you drive, if you are impared, overweight, injured, how often you get impaired, who your friends are, then I can create a data file on you as an individual that is very very valuable to credit agencies and insurance agencies. If they wanted to pay for access to my data model or my API it would be very valuable. If I plug that into Facebook so now I am able to pull all that together with your Facebook profile, who your online friends are, who you get into physical proximity with, I can make a profile about you so accurate that I could predict if you're going to go to jail in the next year, drive impaired, have an accident, lose your job, etc. There is no data protection right now that prevents me from using all that data to build a very in-depth profile about you and sell it. Even better, you don't even have to know it exists (and it does). 

We are less than 10 years out from people being held out of jobs based on AI decision makers that came from data models built on social media profiles, online fingerprints. We are less than 10 years out from the complete loss of anonymity online.  You could pump public posts through an AI-enabled scanner and even profiles made under a fake name could look at writing patterns and probably nail down you as an individual behind a proxy, posting anonymously. 

We are less than 20 years from someone weaponizing that in a way that included kinetic warfare such as an extremist government targeting individual users in authoritarian states who believed they were anonymous. The US isn't exempt, already Facebook and Google are helping prosecute women who are seeking abortions. We are 0 years away from AI supporting authoritarianism. We are less than 50 from a person using AI to help identify predictors of ideological differences and persecuting people who hold those beliefs (or will hold those beliefs) before they are even formed. 

My starkest prediction (again, as someone who has been working with data models and embedded electronics since the late 1980s) is that by the year 2075 is that AI will be weaponized to shape ideologies by identifying and removing non-conformant ideologists before they are old enough to graduate high school.

* Bring a pot of water to a boil
* put in a generous amount of salt, squeeze in a few lemons, go ahead and chuck the peels in too. Add your favorite spices. Bayleaf, coriander, and black pepper are mandatory, the rest is up to you. Or just buy Zataran's shrimp & crab boil seasoning.
* Put small potatoes in the water (they'll need 10-20 min, depending on size)
* When the potatoes are almost done, put shell-on shrimp in the water (heads or no, up to you, 3-5 min)
* Put chunks of smoked sausage in the water (2 min)
* Put broken up corn cobs in the water (2 min)

-----

It lives up to it's name, but actually has such an intriguing story, bizarre, one of a kind & often over the top characters, all presented with stunning, unique visuals. Adopted from the manga of the same name created by Araki, who took inspiration from Saks fifth avenue models for his art, this is an anime that so distinctly separates itself from all the others in terms of original art, (admittedly fabulous) style, & an unorthodox use of Western music from rock, pop, & even rap & r&b legends. Seriously, this show is crazy good, emphasis on the *crazy.* 

The setting takes place in England in the 1800s, & features immortal vampire zombies, & it gets even more interesting from there, all while maintaining an atmosphere of suspense, whimsical (& at times dirty/sexual) humor, & still remains respectively *cool.* 

The battles that take place are so different from what you see in anime life DBZ or Naruto. Each character employs their own strategy, & it's becomes an action packed game of chess, & is often gory, tho tastefully so, IMHO.

The only downside is that it is definitively occultic, & at times seems to sympathize with blatantly hateful & inhumane ideologies, but that's anime for ya. I can watch it & still manage to enjoy TF out of it.

A doctor has done a YouTube video explaining the metabolic process and how it works.  Secondly, I sleep cold.  A persons body burns more calories maintaining homeostasis than anything else.  If you lower your thermostat to below 68 degrees and sleep with only a sheet it forces your body to burn calories at a higher rate, but it takes some getting use to and I do not have a SO to complain either.",3,0,5,5,,5,Impressive-Floor-700,EcoBlunderBrick123,0

What are weight loss tips that work?,"I tried Low-Carb, 10 days transformation (purium), 10 weeks body change (d'soost), and more.

But the most comfort and success I found with a form of Intermittent Fasting that fits to me:

Alternate Day Fasting  - also known as ADF, 1:1, 12:36 and 10in2: 
1 day eating.  
1 day not.

The formula:  
1 = eating (whatever I want, no restrictions, keep as healthiest as possible but in case no regrets (but keep it less) keep track of kcal-in)  
0 = zero in-take (only water, tee, black coffee)  
* In case of special events I shift the fasting days or replace other eating days with self-made-vegetable-smoothies or soups. So not super strict, as long its not regularly.
* its around 12 hours eating window (1 day) and around 36 hours (1,5 day) fasting.

The bottom line of all is - change your life style and diet - forever.  
Live and eat healthier and do some sports.

For me helped also change my mind ""You are what you eat"",  ""do I just want to be - or - do i really want to"" and hang up some pictures and texts around that reminds me on that before opening the fridge or snacks-corner.  
Every week this helps me feeling great to be closer to the beach-body I want.

What are weight loss tips that work?,"The only way to lose weight is to consume fewer calories than you burn each day so you should look up how many calories you need each day based on your age/sex/height to lose weight at a healthy rate, which is about 2-3 lbs/week.

Counting your calories for 2 weeks will give you a clear enough picture of what eating healthy looks like so you can stop counting and just make a conscious effort to continue eating the same way. These are the biggest things I noticed that helped me to lose weight effectively when I was counting every calorie.

Don't wait until you're full to stop eating. Stop when you no longer feel hungry. 

Reduce daily intake of calories by limiting breads, fats, condiments, sweets and deep fried foods.

Drink more water. 

Use spices for flavor instead of adding extra salt. Salt retains water so it causes swelling. 

Limit meat portions to ¼-⅓ lb per meal. This will increase your energy level so you can burn the calories you need to.

If you're still hungry after a meal, eat more veggies

Use smaller dishes so smaller servings look bigger. 

Play slow music while you eat and chew your food thoroughly before swallowing. Both will aid in digestion. 

Cheat on your diet one day a week. Don't lock yourself up with a whole cake and a gallon of ice cream; just take in extra calories, especially in the form of whatever foods you've been limiting that you miss the most. This will boost your dieting mood and reset your caloric burn rate so you can continue to lose the 2-3 lbs/week. 

Don't weigh yourself more than once a week and try to do it at the same time of day. This should maximize your motivation. 

Get a good night's sleep as often as you can. Using your bed for sex and sleeping only will help. If you have problems falling asleep, consider taking melatonin.",1,0,5,5,,5,sam_grace,EcoBlunderBrick123,0

The problem is that capitalism, especially in America, *isn't doing this*. Regulatory capture, legalized bribery through lobbying, a lack of an effective criminal justice system for the wealthy and corporations, and large businesses utilize those things to fight taxation, and either prevent, water down, or outright end programs that are supposed to make up for capitalisms shortfalls.

What did a partner do that made you break up with them?,"When I was 18 I had a ""17 year old"" girlfriend for about 2 weeks. Only ever kissed a bit but nothing more, thank God.

I knew the game they were playing and told them that it was nice to hear them talk dirty to me but that they should tell my g/f that I don't play those kinds of games and not to contact me again.

A few days later a friend asked if I broke up with her and when I told him I had he said good because she had just turned 13 the week prior.

""How could you not tell the difference between a 17 and 12 year old girl?""

Do you believe in paranormal activities? Why yes and why not?,"I believe in them, and my grandfather is the reason for that.
He was a very good and honest man. Even if he was just telling a fictional story to put you to bed, he would tell you so beforehand. Whenever somebody had brought up anything to do with snow, he’d tell us about the elk he hit in a blizzard while he was a long-haul trucker in Maine during the late 60s (he was a trucker for 40 years). Two years ago (about three months before he passed), he asked me to come over for a visit. I immediately knew something was off when I walked through the door because he avoided eye contact and was fiddling with his hands, this was not normal for him. He asked me to sit down and told me that the elk story he’d been telling all the years, was only half true. He said that everything was true, except he didn’t hit an elk. These were his exact words. “This has been eating me up for 60 years (he was 92 at the time of my visit) I was driving up I-95 in the middle of nowhere in Maine. Visibility was getting worse, so I decided that I was gonna slow down. Seeing as how there wasn’t anyone around me, I thought it wouldn’t cause anyone a headache. As I began to slow down, I saw this dark Mass running from the right, just off the highway. It was like slow motion. The thing moved so fast that my instincts hadn’t bothered to go into action. It slammed into the grill (I think he said grill but just imagine the front of the truck), essentially totaling my truck. I thought it was an animal, so I grabbed my shotgun because I wanted to put it out of it’s misery. Nothing was there. I hadn’t noticed it, but it seems like after I hit it, it bounced off and continued running. I saw the footprints leading away from where I hit it. My truck wasn’t in a drivable condition, so in my fear induced mind, I started running to the next town (he was in amazing shape for most of his life). I ran ten miles constantly looking over my shoulder, thinking I was gonna meet the Almighty at any given moment, until I hit a phone booth in the closest town. Because of my time in Korea, I know what hallucinations were. I also knew that people wouldn’t hire you if they knew you had hallucinations. So I told nobody. I had proof of it, because I took some hair that was on the front of the truck. But I only kept it to let myself know that it was real. I lost the hair when our house burned down in the 70s. But I know what hit me was not an animal.” He then slumped back into the couch, I guess he’d been holding it in for so long that it become a massive burden to him. Before that, I’d only seen fear in his eyes when he was talking about the Korean War. Also, when he talked about “it”, it was the only time I’d ever seen him truly terrified.",0,0,8,8,,8,AutisticFloridaMan,TheAmenophis,0

Additionally, no spirit or otherworldly force has ever agreed to fight me, and it turns out once you start challenging these experiences and feelings literally as well as intellectually, they stop happening to you.  

So, either I'm a shining transcendent soul able to exorcise all manner of supernatural presences with the holy incantation of ""come at me, bro"" or it's all brain trickery.

  She ended up winning and was really being a sore winner, trash talking everyone.  I finally spoke up and told her that she'd been cheating the whole game.  She got really upset but then a couple other players spoke up and said they'd noticed as well but we all kept our mouth shut because we just met.

"People who have tried shrooms, what are the cons?","Shrooms are way better than acid I will say that, with that being said Psychedlics in general have a few cons.  I'll list them in order of least bad to most bad.

&#x200B;

I. Nightmares: Unlike acid you can still sleep on shrooms, but there's a good chance you're going to have crazy crazy nightmares.

&#x200B;

II. You have to actually ingest mushrooms, and mushrooms taste like shit: They're awful, they're awful with peanut butter, they're awful on pizza, they're awful in sandwiches, they're awful by itself. There's 10mg chocolate bars that you can buy for like forty dollars (USD), and that's been the only thing that has been tolerable in my experience, but even then it's gross.

&#x200B;

III. The body high can be overwhelming: The best I can describe how it makes me feel physically is that my soul wants to jump out of my skeleton, and my skeleton wants to jump out of my skin. It's not a very pleasant experience. You can ignore it easily enough, but once you focus on it it's hard to snap out of that focus.

&#x200B;

IV. Your mentality prior to ingestion will dictate your high: If you're relaxed and happy and in a good mood then chances are you'll have a really nice time. If you're anxious and stressed then it will not be lit fam. Pair a bad mentality with #3 and you'll literally just want to hide under a blanket and die. which leads to the worst aspect.

&#x200B;

V. TIME . . .  SUCKS: That's the understatement of the century. There's something about psychedelics that completely distort a human's conception of time, and doing anything, ANYTHING at all timewise will feel like something between 5 minutes and 500 years. That is the best I can describe it.

&#x200B;

Overall, it can really be an enjoyable experience, but I wouldn't do them alone, I would make sure that I'm sure I'm in a good mood and ready to be enlightened. (Or feel that way) and Remember that with any great high comes a great fall. You'll feel weird and kind of grey for about two or three days afterwards.",7,0,5,5,,5,Saint_Circa,Momsemann,0

Coming down, I'll get the worst stomach cramps, but for some reason a glass of orange juice makes the whole thing better.

"People who have tried shrooms, what are the cons?","Psilocybin is very different from LSD in that the effect is highly variable depending on your mindset and can fluctuate wildly in a single trip, ranging from dark and terrifying to blissful and enlightening.

"People who have tried shrooms, what are the cons?","You can have a bad trip. It’s a shitty time. You’ll be fine, but it will suck while you’re there.

"People who have tried shrooms, what are the cons?","Not me, but what I've heard from my ex after a bad trip he had.

He took WAY too high of a dose, and according to him he couldn't sleep for almost twelve hours after taking them. I don't know if he was still high when he went to sleep or after he woke up, but he specifically remembered that he couldn't sleep. He also made a point about complaining about nausea and vomiting.

One piece of advice that he stressed is to do it when you can have someone stay there for the *entire* trip. He took them in the evening with a buddy who had to work the next day; said buddy went to sleep after five or six hours. Part of this is because time literally doesn't exist, according to him, so having someone there to help you with time is crucial. He also noted that the clock he was using was broken, probably from a power outage, so it was flashing 1:20 the entire trip. He started to panic that he was in a time loop.

He also recommended cooking them, as (I believe) that helps your body process them, and reduces the chance of having too strong or long of a trip.

[Serious] How do you cope with the passing of someone you are close to?,"That's a difficult question. I belive it's different for everyone but I'll share my experience.

It's extremely difficult. First you need to come to terms with the situation in your own head - that part will be easier if this was something you saw coming (e.g. the person was sick before).
Then it's about taking it one day at a time if I'm being honest. For me it helped writing in my notes app as if I was talking to the person. I still do that a lot. 

And no matter how many times people have said this, time doesn't make it easier. It doesn't heal anything. You just get used to it.",3,0,2,2,,2,book-sportslover,thicboi420,0
[Serious] How do you cope with the passing of someone you are close to?,"You must let yourself cry.

Some people prefer to do it alone. Others want someone with them as sort of an anchor for the chaos, and for comfort when needed. Whatever you choose to do, you must allow yourself to cry. it's going to happen sooner or later. it's going to hurt a lot, and it's going to look very ugly, but it's part of the natural healing process. It may not happen in a day, or even a week. but you will need to face the reality that they are gone, and allow yourself to grieve that fact.

Once you've done that, remember to reflect on what they meant to you. Relate some of your favorite memories with them, tell the joke they always told even if you used to hate it. Remember who they were to you, and hold that in your heart.

Eventually you will find peace. I cannot say when, or how, but you will find it if you allow yourself to feel, to cry, to remember, and to move on.",3,0,2,2,,2,BleedingRaindrops,thicboi420,0

I basically like everything around sex itself - making out, physical intimacy, being naked together, a lot of kinky stuff - so just because I'm not inherently attracted to others doesn't mean I can't occasionally enjoy the act itself as well. 

I often describe it like giving someone else a massage. It's physically intimate, often times emotionally intimate too, and there is lots of skin.

Which golden age (1998-2006) Cartoon Network character is the best?,"The golden age of American animation was a period in the history of U.S. animation that began with the popularization of sound cartoons in 1928 and gradually ended in the late 1960s, where theatrical animated shorts began losing popularity to the newer medium of television animation, produced on cheaper budgets and in a more limited animation style by companies such as Hanna-Barbera, UPA, Jay Ward Productions, and DePatie-Freleng.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_of_American_animation#:~:text=The%20golden%20age%20of%20American,on%20cheaper%20budgets%20and%20in


The Golden Age of Animation is a period in the History of Animation that is generally agreed to have begun on November 18th, 1928, with the release of Steamboat Willie, and cemented with Fleischer's, Warner's and MGM's rise to prominence in the years following. It gradually faded out from the early 50s to late 60s note  when theatrical animated shorts lost ground to the new (and far lower budget) medium of television animation.

To ask how they are different implies a misunderstanding of the terms. There's nothing the same about them to begin with.",1,0,1,1,,1,throwaway_0x90,estaire95,0

(read below) how are u supposed to feel when ur significant other prioritizes their mother over u?,"It depends what you mean by prioritize. As long as your needs are being met, it's fine for him to want to spend time/look after his mother, especially if he is from one the particularly elderly-reverent cultures. If it gets to the point where he is consistently choosing his mother over you though, that's when you need to have the discussion about it not being okay. At the end of the day, just like he chooses to be with you, he chooses how important to him you are in his life.

(read below) how are u supposed to feel when ur significant other prioritizes their mother over u?,"my significant other has laid out his list of priorities and his mother came before, and this slightly bothers me -- but here is why 

and before i clarify, i'd like to mention that i understand she birthed him and is his mother but he has explained that she wasn't really the person who was there for him growing up and that it was his grandmother who raised and understood him as a child 

he currently is living under her roof, with the rent being $250 and she continued to allow him to stay there after a mistake he made -- but he has said ""my mom comes before u, sorry, but i wouldn't be in this world if she hadn't birthed me"" which is very true, but there is more to parenting and being a mother than just birthing 

growing up, my biological mama abandoned me and left me to fend for myself with my abusive father (it's a long story), a lot happened and i never really had a childhood so maybe my understanding of what it's like to have a mama that's at least around, or to have a relationship at all with ur parents, is foreign to me 

i have abandonment issues not only in parental standards, but also in every other category of relationship so maybe it's just my jealousy or problems responding to this? i need advice, is he a mama's boy? how do i discuss this with him?",1,0,1,1,,1,uhohera,uhohera,0

How common is it for parents to have a wedding fund for their daughter(s)?,"Traditionally, the bride's father paid for the wedding and the groom's father paid for the honeymoon.  This was for the upper class, but that's who most stories are about and middle-class and lower-class families often try to follow this.

Brides were ""given away"" by their father, often in an arranged marriage, and the wedding was as much about impressing the in-laws and friends as it was about the new couple.

Lavish weddings that cost more than a car or a down payment on a home are rediculous unless the family can also gift a car or home.

There are some very traditional families that still do this, and they often take great pride in scraping up money for big events like quincineara, graduations, weddings, etc., but often guests are expected to gift money to help out.

How is this keeping your heart open?” They were on the path on the other side of the trees, and the woman was walking away from the guy. 

I heard someone walking through the woods towards me. It was the guy. When he saw me he smiled and said, “hey, you’re Luke, aren’t you?” I said no, and for some reason told him my actual name. He shook my hand and asked, “what are you doing, listening?” I told him I was looking for a disc. He was like, “oh, you’re a disc golfer, huh?” He said that something had been opened, but I wasn’t sure what to make of that.

Then he looked into my eyes and said calmly, “you’re all fucked. You’re all fucked and you don’t even know it.” It was at that point I turned and walked away, leaving my disc and never coming back for it. I don’t think I’ve been back to that park since.

She was a doctor in a rural part of China, and when poor people have a son who is sick they will borrow money to save his life but for a daughter they will just say they don't have the money. There was a man who visited the hospital with a sick daughter who was 10 or so and the medication to cure her illness was about 1000 yuan (maybe $150 in the 90s) and the man shook his head and said he didn't have the money. The daughter was listening next to him and she pulled the dad's arm and said ""let's go home"" because she felt her life wasn't worth the money either.

In the end the doctors and nurses at the hospital felt so bad for the girl they contributed out of their own salaries to save the girl's life.",1,0,2,2,,2,Otototototototoi,Zkrlty,0
