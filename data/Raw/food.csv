Couple of years ago, I made up a Yorkshire Poutine (for context, chips and gravy is essentially our national dish so it translates well) with some slow roasted lamb on top, juices in the onion gravy, and covered in half melted apricot wensleydale. All served in a giant yorkshire pudding.

[homemade] These eggs live up to their name- crack eggs aka the Korean mayak eggs (soft boiled eggs in a heavenly marinade),"Recipe if anyone wants to try: these eggs go well ramen, fried rice or with just plain rice even (make sure you douse the marinade liquid on top)😋 

12 eggs (room temp)

Marinade ingredients: 
Finely chopped garlic- as much as you can handle ( I think I used around 1.5 tbsp)
2 stalks of spring onions including the white part- finely chopped
2 tbsp toasted white sesame seeds
1 finely chopped green chilli (can use more if you want to)
1/2 cup light soy sauce
1/2 cup dark soy sauce
1 cup rice syrup (can substitute with maple syrup)
1/2 cup white vinegar

Mix all the marinade ingredients in a container that you want to store your eggs at. 
Keep an ice bath for the cooked eggs ready.
Cook your eggs (soft boiled)- abt 5 mins for that runny egg.  I added a splash of vinegar to the boiling water before adding the eggs to peel them easily.
Immediately transfer the eggs to the ice bath. Once cooled completely, peel eggs and add them to the marinade.
Refrigerate for a minimum of 12 hours before you dig in.
You can store it in the fridge for a good week or so. I topped up with more eggs when my supply was running low 😆 
Once the eggs were done, I used the remaining marinade for a quick fried rice with a protein of your choice.",26,0,146,146,,146,Bulky-Statement-7611,Bulky-Statement-7611,0

[homemade] These eggs live up to their name- crack eggs aka the Korean mayak eggs (soft boiled eggs in a heavenly marinade),It looks like you may have done it but just in case.  The eggs float so there’s always some part sticking out of the marinade.  A great way to make sure all sides of the egg get soaked in is to put napkins down on top of the liquid.  The napkins will absorb the liquid and sink a bit as the eggs marinate.  So you don’t get that bit that’s not as soaked in as the rest because it was sticking out of the juice.,1,0,146,146,,146,The_Coil,Bulky-Statement-7611,0

[homemade] Spaghetti with chicken-pesto-mornay sauce,"Everything in-order:

1. Start spaghetti boiling - about half way through, initiate with the sauce.
2. A little bit of olive oil and margarine in a pan - let it reach bubbling/frying.
3. Then add the chicken - season generously with salt and pepper (I even added some of this local ""steak salt"", worked really well).
4. Then add diced sweet red pepper and onion \~1 min after seasoning.
5. Pour \~2-3 tablespoon of regular soy sauce to the mix.
6. After frying everything together for \~1½-2 min, add the mornay sauce.
7. Let it simmer for a few minutes, then season it to your liking.

**IMPORTANT**: When straining the spaghetti water from the spaghetti, leave some in there, or else the mornay sauce will become incredibly thick and kind of sticky.

8. After sauce has been simmering, add the pesto then mix (I did arond 2-3 tablespoons).

9. Pour everything from the pan to the pot and mix it well (Sauce to spaghetti).  


10. Plate and add a little fresh pepper on top.

I'll entertain the idea that I have lost my mind and can no longer remember how to boil an egg, but I really feel like eggs have changed.

They used to have stronger shells. They used to form a smaller footprint when you fry them, rather than sloshing all over the pan like a puddle of water. Is my memory going? Does anyone else feel this way?",2,0,8,8,,8,WG50,WG50,0

[homemade] Crispy Fried Shrimps.,"Wash and clean the shrimps well. 

Apply a Litt Turmeric, a pinch of pepper, a pinch of cornstarch, a little Kashmiri red chilli powder if you have any, salt (as much as you prefer). Mix them with the shrimps thoroughly in a bowl.

Turn on the gas stove, keep it on high flame. Put a wok or a nonstick frying pan on the flame. Let it get warm a bit for a few seconds. Add some vegetable oil to a point that you can almost dip fry the shrimps (you don't have to try them altogether, you can do it in batches if you're preparing many, doesn't take much time.

When the oil is hot and slight smoke is coming out of it, it is ready. Turn the gas to a little bit lower than high and add the mix prepared shrimps to the oil. It will sizzle, if the oil is not too deep, keep turning the shrimps to let it fry evenly on each side. Do not fry them for very long, because it will become rubbery and chewy.

Once they appear crisp, pick them up from the oil with a spoon or whatever you prefer to use, and let them rest on a paper towel to let out excess oil.

And it's done.. enjoy your delicious Crispy Fried Shrimps.",1,0,10,10,,10,ThePunisher213,ThePunisher213,0

I stopped into the local butcher this afternoon and snagged some gorgeous prime beef short ribs. 

Dry brined for a short while, seared, then braised in red wine and stock. Veg, aromatics, etc…

Reduced the braising liquid. Touch of balsamic to cut the acidity. Porcini powder. 

Hollandaise made with white miso and just a touch of Dijon. I like the acid and funk it adds. And it’s an emulsifier so that just a plus. 

Cauliflower purée. Steeped in cream with aromatics, garlic, white pepper. Hint of celery salt. Shit loads of butter.

Pickled shallots and celery leaf salad for garnish. 

Very happy. Very full.

Grab some Italian sausage sweet or hot- take off the casing and brown it in a big pot-  remove the cooked meat and drain the excess oil. 
Throw in a stick of butter and some onions, garlic, peppers, maybe some carrots. 
Brown them up then throw in a can or two of chicken broth and bring it to a boil.
Add your noodle of choice - I like elbows -and cook til Al-dente
Reduce heat and add back in the sausage - add some cream , parmesan and spinach.   salt, pepper to taste and top with Italian parsley.

[Homemade] Mozzarella Garlic Bread.,"Ok ok ok ok I see your recipe comments. The hardest thing about his was the garlic butter I poured over the bread before baking. I will preface this by saying I don’t measure anything out Im eye balling and providing best measurements accordingly. 

Bread: easiest thing is to go to your grocery store and buy a premade garlic bread loaf from the Bakery section they cut it horizontal in half and pre loaded with garlic butter spread. 

Cut through the top half of the loaf across ways but not all the way through the bottom half of the loaf, then cut the top half of the loaf down the middle (but not all the way through) to create the look in the photo. 

Preheat oven 375F

Garlic Butter Drizzle:

1 whole garlic bulb cleaned and minced

A little red onion minced (think veeery tiny)

Dash Italian seasoning (more than a dash maybe)

Salt and pepper 

1 stick butter (if you have salted dont add salt above only pepper)

Drizzle avacado/olive oil in pan


Heat pan over medium heat and add garlic and onion

Sauté until flavors have released. 

Add butter and reduce to low heat

Once butter melts add herbs and combine.  

Simmer lightly for a couple of mins but do not brown the butter

Remove from heat. Set aside

Once butter is done take mozzarella and shred it. Low moisture preferably. Then fill the slits in the loaf with that tasty mozz shred. Fill it!

Once the mozz is in the cracks, pour the butter evenly over the loaf. 


Bake uncovered until done about 12 mins or so. Just watch it.

"[Homemade] - Denver Roast-Beef, Garlic-Herb Potatoes and Bacon-Mustard-Cream Sauce","# Recipe

## Meat
* I use a denver cut, but you can do this with any roasting meat.
* Some neutral high smoking point oil. (I use canola)
* Salt and black pepper to taste. (I use unbleached sea-salt for the meat)

### Preparation
1. Preheat oven as high as it will go, anything around 220c mark is good.
2. Pat the meat dry with paper towels.
3. Rub the meat with oil and season with salt and pepper all over.
4. Place the meat on an oven rack with a pan under it to catch all the fat and juices and put it in the oven.
5. Cook until reaching an internal temperature to your liking. 
(I like mine medium rare, so I cook it until it reaches about 50c; 
remove from the oven about 5c before because it will continue to cook after you remove it from the oven)
6. Remove the meat from the oven and cover loosely with tin-foil. (don't turn off the oven just yet, you'll need it for the potatoes)
7. Let the meat rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing.

## Potatoes
* About 1kg of potatoes washed thoroughly of any dirt, un-peeled cut into wedges.
* Garlic and herbs to taste. (fresh, dry, whatever you have on hand)
* Olive oil. (or bacon fat if you have it)
* Salt and black pepper to taste.

### Preparation
1. Preheat to around 220c mark.
2. Par-boil the potatoes in salted water until they are just tender. (start with cold water and bring it to boil with the potatoes)
**THE IMPORTANT PART**: add a few tablespoons of baking soda to the water, 
this will help the potatoes crisp up much better. (yes, baking soda, this pro-tip comes from J. Kenji López-Alt)
3. Drain the potatoes, and let them cool down and dry a bit allowing the steam to escape.
4. Thoroughly oil your roasting pan and toss the potatoes in it with salt and pepper to taste until they are covered on all sides.
5. Place the potatoes flat on a baking tray, try to spread them as loosely as possible, don't stack them, 
and make sure they touch the metal pan.
If you need to, use two pans.
6. Roast the potatoes in the oven until they are just golden brown and crispy. Making sure to turn them every so often, 
so they will crisp up on all sides.
7. 4-5 minutes before the potatoes are done, remove from the oven and toss them in the garlic and herbs mixture.
8. Return to the oven and roast for another 4-5 minutes.
9. Remove from oven and scrape with a spatula to make sure they are not stuck to the roasting pan.

**TIP**: I suggest you do this on a bare metal roasting tray/pan. don't use tin-foil or parchment paper.
The potatoes will stick to it, or they won't get crispy.

I know it requires a bit more clean up, but it's worth it.

## Sauce
This specific sauce is a bacon-mustard-cream sauce, with garlic and rosemary. but you can make whatever sauce you want,
or skip it altogether.

* Bacon (smoked preferably) cut into very little cubes.
* Dijon mustard to taste.
* About 250ml of heavy cream. (you can thin it out during the cooking with milk if you need to)
* Fine chopped garlic and rosemary to taste.
* Salt and pepper to taste.

### Preparation
1. Render the bacon in a pan until it is crispy and golden brown.
2. At this point you can drain some bacon fat if you want, but I like to keep most of it in.
3. Add salt and pepper to taste.
4. Add garlic and rosemary and cook for a minute or two.
5. Turn the heat down to low and add the mustard and cream, stir until it is well incorporated and cook for about 3-5 minutes.
6. You can add some milk to if it starts getting too thicc; at this point you should taste and adjust seasoning if needed.
7. Remove from heat and serve over the meat or so the side, it also goes great with the potatoes.",6,0,58,58,,58,topaz1008,topaz1008,0

[Homemade] Pączki - Polish doughnuts,"For people asking about the recipe, I've translated the Polish one I used.

Pączki - Recipe

**Ingredients:**

\- 500 grams of wheat flour

\- 250 millilitres of warm milk

\- 4 eggs (yolks precisely)

\- 40 grams of sugar

\- 25 grams of fresh yeast

\- 50 grams of butter 

\- a pinch of salt (literally)

\- \~750ml - 800ml of oil (I prefer coconut/rapeseed oil)

\- 2-3 tablespoons of vodka/rum (optional)

**Note**: you can easily skip adding alcohol, it's said to reduce the amount of oil that gets soaked up in the process of frying, that's why I use it, but it doesn't make a huge difference if you decide not to use it.

&#x200B;

Make sure the eggs are room-temp, so take them out of the fridge some time before you start. Once they're room-temp gently divide the yolks from the whites as you'll only need the yolks. You can either make something else with the whites or throw them out. I'll suggest a short recipe at the end for the whites that you can make in the meantime while you wait for your doughnut dough to rise.

&#x200B;

1. Warm the milk, it doesn't have to be hot, just lukewarm.

Melt the butter in another casserolle.

Make sure the milk stays warm (low heat), but don't let it cook. Once the butter melts, let it cool down.

&#x200B;

2. In a bowl: mix 1 tablespoon of flour, 1 tablespoon of sugar and 3 tablespoons of warm milk together with yeast in order to make 'sourdough'. Make sure it's mixed well, put a cotton cloth over it and let it stand in a warm spot for around 15-25mins so it can rise and become slightly ""bubbly"".

&#x200B;

3. In a bigger bowl: put the rest of the flour, salt, yolks, 2 tablespoons of sugar, melted butter, the rest of the warm milk and the sourdough together.

You can now add 2-3 tablespoons of vodka/rum now if you want to, but you don't have to. Once you have all the ingredients in the bowl start kneading the dough in the bowl using your hands (make sure they're properly washed beforehand!).

If you have a good mixer that can knead dough you can easily skip using your hands and use your mixer instead. Knead the dough for around 5 minutes. The dough should be quite smooth, but also very sticky.

&#x200B;

4. Keep the dough in the bowl, cover it with a cotton cloth and put it away in a warm spot for an hour minimum so it can rise. I usually let it stand for around 90 minutes so the dough can rise even more.

&#x200B;

5. On a flat surface (be it a pastry board or a clean kitchen countertop): put a bit of flour (not too much) on the surface and then gently start rolling the dough with a kitchen roller. It should be around 2,5cm (0.98in) thick. Next, get yourself a round cookie cutter that's 7cm (2,75in) wide or a normal water glass.

Once the dough's been rolled, start cutting out smaller pieces with the cookie cutter/glass and place them on a board/tray that you can move around. If you run out of space to cut out more doughnuts, gently knead the dough again, roll it over, cut out more doughnuts and repeat the process unless you're out of dough. Put doughnuts one next to each other but leave some space in between because once you're done with the tray, you should put a cloth over it yet again, put the tray with the doughnuts in a warm spot for around 30mins and let them rise again.

Normally you should get around 18-20 doughnuts out of that dough.

&#x200B;

6. It's time to fry them, **be very careful not to burn yourself here as you'll be using a lot of hot oil.** 

Pour 700ml of oil into a medium casserolle and heat it to the temperature of 175C (347F). Prepare some paper towels on the side where you'll be putting the fried doughnuts.

Start with putting only one doughnut into the casserolle (**use kitchen tongs!**) to make sure the oil is the right temperature. If the dough turns darkish brown too fast, it means that the oil's too hot and you need to cool it down a bit.

Typically you should fry each doughnut for 2-3 minutes on each side so they're fried all the way through. I usually use 2.5min on each side.

Once you're done frying, put the doughnuts out onto the paper towels that you've prepared beforehand and let the extra oil soak into the paper. Let the doughnut cool down for a short while. Once they cool down you can start filling them with your favourite fillings.

&#x200B;

About filling: you can fill your doughnuts before you fry them, but it usually makes it slightly harder to properly 'close' them afterwards and they might not be as round as you'd like them to be. I usually fill my doughnuts after I'm done frying them. You can use a cooking syringe/culinary injector, just fill it up with your favourite jam or other filling, put it inside the doughnut and start filling gently.

You can have a topping of your choice, be it powdered sugar, frosting or some other sweet topping that you'd prefer.",21,0,3376,3376,,3376,distantLights_,distantLights_,0

In Germany those are called Berliner or Krapfen. They get filled with different creams. I like a Hiffenmark filling most. Hiffen is a regional word for Hagebutte. In english it's rose hip.

[Homemade] Steak medallions with mushroom vole au vent,"I used to make vol au vent dishes like crazy for Sunday dinner service back in my chef days, but they were usually chicken or pork based. (For those wondering, ""vole au vent"" is a French type of pot pie. It's a puff pastry with a filling.) If you head to coastal France or Northern Spain in the bay towns you'll even see them filled with fish or prawn.

Au vents have fallen out of style over the decades...you still see them once in a great while at old-fashioned steakhouses (the type that still serve Green Goddess salad dressing and put curly parsley on everything ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)), but adding mushrooms as a vessel for a side dish is pretty clever.

American, and I grew up eating pork & beans with dinner (never with breakfast, side dish at dinner). We always ate beans cooked. 

Grew up, got married, and the first time my wife ever made beans they were ice cold. I was so shocked the beans just dribbled out of my mouth as I stared at her with contempt.

Thinking this was just an oversight on her part, because what kind of savage opens a can, dumps the contents into a bowl, and then serves it for dinner?  

I've literally become terrified of pork & beans. I keep getting yelled at for sticking my thumb into the pork & beans because she can't be trusted at this point.  She thinks I'm the odd one for cooking them. Chilled pork & beans for the norm at her house.

[Pro/Chef] Garlic Burnt Butter Creamy Mushroom Sauce with Steak,"You can watch a full recipe video here: https://youtu.be/JdUH63VMftM

Ingredients 

• 4 cloves of Garlic

• Mushrooms

• Steak

• Salt

• Black Pepper

• 100g Unsalted Butter

• Fresh Thyme

• Fresh Parsley

• Chicken stock

• 150 ml Cream

• ¼ tsp White Pepper

Method:
Handy tip: If you grow your own, fresh thyme and parsley from the garden are always best to use and save us a dime. 

Step 1: Slice, Crush, Chop!
Begin by slicing the mushrooms and crushing three cloves of garlic.
Next, chop the parsley

Step 2: Heatin’ Up
Be sure to have the steak at least 1 inch thick. 
Heat a pan over high heat. 
Season the steak with salt and pepper, but not the fat cap.

Step 3: Get Cookin’
Place the seasoned meat into the hot pan. I find cast iron works best because it heats evenly and gets really hot giving a better sear.
Sear the steak on all sides. 

Step 4: Delightful Additions
Turn down the heat and add unsalted butter, garlic cloves, and thyme. Using unsalted butter allows us to better control the taste of the dish.
Base the meat by spooning the garlic cloves and thyme onto the top of the steak, followed by the butter. Do this for all sides.

Step 5: Not so Rare
Use an instant-read thermometer to check the internal temperature of the steak. We’re aiming for Medium rare, which is 55 degrees Celsius or 130 degrees Fahrenheit but it’s best to take the steak off a few degrees early as the steak will continue to cook with the residual heat.
Remove the steak and thyme, placing aside to rest while leaving garlic to remain in the pan.

Step 6: Get the Sauce Going
Crush the garlic with a fork. All the garlic and burnt butter will help create a rich flavourful sauce.
Deglaze the pan with chicken stock then throw in the mushrooms and cook. 
Add 150ml of cream, bring to a simmer and allow to thicken. 

Step 7: Time of the Season
Season with a pinch of salt, add additional seasoning to your liking.
Add a ¼ of a teaspoon of white pepper, your parsley and the resting steak juices.

The best way to tell when your sauce is ready is if the sauce coats the back of the spoon. This is called Nappe to describe a liquid or sauce consistency thick enough to coat your favourite stirring spoon and hold the shape of your tongue as you lick it.

Step 8: Enjoy!
And we’re all ready to go, plate up your steak and pour over your sauce.
Outro: You can’t deny how delicious this steak and sauce combo really is!
