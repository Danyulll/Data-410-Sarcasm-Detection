First of all, just by lurking and observing women's spaces online you can pretty easily tell that women complement each other far more often than men do. Why? Well, DV, reproductive coercion, exploitation for mental/physical work, SA, neglect - you know, all the hits abusive partners like to play - are happening predominantly in heterosexual relationships and it's no secret that in most instances, even though it happens, men aren't the victims of it.

Second of all, nobody is denying men anything. You don't have a right to be given a partner. Having someone in your life is a privilege, and if you are unable to be a decent partner yourself, you won't get one.

Third of all, what kind of f#cking creep are you? Telling a woman you don't know you're ready to take her as a wife. This attitude right here and above is probably a lead cause of why you're only on ""standby"".

Most of my friends have historically been women, by choice.

I’ve found as a man that women bring a lot more to the table as friends than other guys do.

Women tend to understand emotions better, make better conversationalists, and have higher levels of compassion than men tend to, again in my personal experience. Women are also generally speaking more creative and think in more abstract ways than men do. This in my experience has led to much deeper conversations and I’ve learnt a lot more about life from women than I have from men.

It was from a woman that 14 years old I learnt about existentialism, for instance. I have to think most of my 14 year old peers wouldn’t even have known what that word meant. 

Again the above are just my experiences and are not meant to act as scientific data.

99% of my platonic relationships by choice are women. Women bring a hell of a lot more to the table than “just sex” or “just as a romantic partner.”

Women are wonderful. And ought to be celebrated. 

What every incel forgets is that it was the hard work of a woman carrying you for nine months and then literally straining her body to birth you that they are here.

"610","Do any of these men making this type of post actually like women?",0
"611","The way he worded the second part differently to make women still seem like the bad guys",0
"612","I am a professional massage therapist and a best-selling cookbook author. You know what that means, right? I can give a great massage and I can cook. When I got together with my husband I was earning $50/hour in 1990 dollars; I have made over a million bucks with the cookbooks. 

My SIL makes more money than my brother, though he does okay. Her job also provides their health insurance. My sister, a teacher, supports my BIL and has all along. She’s also the one accruing a public pension. 

But do go on about how we bring nothing to the table but sex.",0

"615","If you’re taking away women’s money, I’d expect more than 90% wouldn’t want to be in a relationship with you",0
"616","A lot of word to explain that he can only get girls while paying.",0
"617","Since it’s a man’s perspective it would be more accurate for him to say “sex is 90% what I care about in a relationship and money is 90% of what I’m willing to contribute to maintain a relationship”",0
"618","My mom never hugged me and now I hate women. Just one step removed from being in a crime special",0
"619","It's missing everything about: ""If you can't be handsome, you should at least be handy."" I feel like this can make up for a portion of the monies.",0
"620","Who’s gonna stay with someone who has no money, how do you expect someone to be attracted to bankruptcy lmao",0
"621","So what’s your expectation, that women put out for some guy without a job?

Also most of the women I know make more money than their male partners. And most men are intimidated by it.",0
"622","90% is a good stat for people making up bullshit because anyone who disagrees is just the mysterious 10% for them",0
"623","Don't know where he is getting his numbers, but I have known far, far too many women in relationships with men who are making less than they do, or are unemployed.

Now, I do not know if these women were having sex with their men or not, but according to this guy, if the woman isn't giving him sex, she is good for nothing. (Except for supporting him when he's unemployed)",0
"624","*HAAHHAHA*

I'm dying. Lemme rephrase that.

""Remove sex from a relationship, and 90% of guys won't find anything worth staying for.

Remove money from a relationship, and 90% of guys will have nothing to offer women in their life.""

Gotta love the little tweak he put in to make it seem like women aren't putting in work to offer anything but sex, but are also super shallow and want nothing but money.",0
"625","I think this person must be living with their parents with none of the above to offer. Hence the post.",0
"626","This is more than misogynist, it's anti-human companionship",0
"627","gosh, just so inspirational, you know? are we not just the luckiest women to have ever lived to be able to say we existed at the same time as this absolute masterpiece?",0
"628","I don't know... sex has been removed from my married life for quite some time due to my husband needing a hip replacement at 43. And I make all the money.... we're very happy. 😊",0
"629","So we should pay women the same amount for doing the same job finally?",0
"630","Interesting how he carefully avoids framing the ""take money out of the relationship and you discover that men have nothing to offer women"" the same way he frames the take sex out of the relationship......

Says a whole lot more about how little he has to offer than he would be comfortable exposing if he was aware of it",0
"631","90% is high, but not as high as this dude on the daily.",0
"632","I bet this tweet was written by a dude on a woman’s couch.",0
"633","I married my wife because I liked hanging our with her more than other people. Seems like a pretty simple plan.",0
"634","I know I'm supposed to be outraged, and I would be, but I'm too tired. 

It just makes me sad, that so many men are so aggressively against developing and nurturing actual relationships. That they're so bitter and spiteful and unhappy that they want to spread misery and malice.",0
"635","No shit these people are so depressed, imagine believing most women can only:

A) offer nothing but looks in a relationship.

B) most women won’t want you because anything else but money.

That’s just a really sad and pathetic view of women and yourself. Fuck that, why not just stay alone and leave these women alone, they are definitely better off without so many shitty men",0
"636","Oh how grateful I am everyday to be asexual.",0
"637","I can definitely see that there could be men and women who can only offer sex, but I don't even see this number being over 5% on either side. 

I really feel genuinely confuzzled over the fact these posts came from real people. We can be equal. I understand not wanting equality out of their relationship. Cool, I hope you both feel that way though. The whole victorian roots that existed like these guys say is awful",0
"638","I luv when misogynists pull random fake facts and statistics out of their asses",0
"639","I’m sure 100% of women have nothing to offer this loser.",0
"640","I’m lucky I got a girl that’ll sleep in a cardboard box with me",0
"641","Nah. It' more like 40%:

* 40% of women have nothing to offer that a man wants except for sex.
* 40% of men have nothing to offer that a woman wants except for money.

The questions left unanswered are:

* How does what men want & women offer responds to hypogamy.
* How does what women want & men offer responds to hypergamy.",0
"642","Nowadays men can’t offer anything else other than income which most women have, and so this is why women initiate divorces most of the time. You can cry, you can downvote, you can watch more Andrew Tate podcasts but y’all know it’s TRUE. ❤️",0
