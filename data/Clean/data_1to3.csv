"AITA for wanting to move away?","NTA 

You're 22, do your thing and explore your opportunities. If your BF doesn't want to come along then y'all are just incompatible and that's okay.",17,0,8,8,"I(22F) and my boyfriend(25M) have been together for about 3 years and have lived together for 1year. He moved in with me to a small city 2hrs from our hometown. I originally moved here to attend college but college wasn’t my thing, so I am just working full time. My boyfriend we’ll call Blake also works. 

Both Blake and I’s family all live back in our hometown, I have a few friends here, but most of our people don’t live near us. I know Blake want to be close to his family, which I totally understand. I don’t have the same relationship with my family and I’ve told Blake many times that I want to travel and live in many places. 

I currently work in forestry and applied to work for a company that is 6hrs away in a different state. I had a phone interview that went well, and have another zoom interview scheduled for next week. There is nothing keeping us here, besides a lease there is no reason for us not to live wherever. Blake doesn’t have a career, and I am working on gaining forestry experience. I told Blake about the interview and how excited I am, this new job would pay me $6 more an hour, I’d have health insurance, a 401k, all the good stuff I don’t have now. 

Blake was not excited about the possibility of moving. He said that I’m “skipping too many chapters” and told me how bad it would be if we moved. He also said he called his dad to “make sure I’m(himself) not going crazy not wanting to move to a place I’ve never been”. I told him if I do get the job I would want to visit the city to look at apartments first so we aren’t going in blind. I also have a friend that lives in that city that would be more than happy to help us find a place. He kept going on about how it’s too much of a crazy thing to do, and it would only end in disaster. 

I know I can be a bit spontaneous and excitable about new things, but i am very good at think things through thoroughly.
I know it’s a lot of work packing up and moving, but it’s for a good reason, better pay and a job that can help me in the future. Blake currently works at a fast food chain, and I said if he wanted to continue with that company he could see about a transfer, or it might be good for him to try something new. I was just so surprised at his lack of support or excitement for me. He knows that i don’t want to live in our current spot for long. If I get offered the job i am going to take it and he can figure out if this is what he wants or not. 

TLDR: I want to move out of state if I get a job offer and my boyfriend doesn’t want to move.",8,"rhomboidus","gracem517",0
"AITA for telling my sister to find her Tree","NTA for the insult- that’s one I haven’t heard before and I love it. 

You are, however, an adult. Even if it’s not common for grown kids to move out where you are, you should consider it. If nothing if else, it sounds like a lock for your door is seriously in order. Your parents are failing both of you miserably by not managing this situation differently. 

I will say, I wonder what would happen if you just didn’t respond to her. If she wants you to clean the kitchen when she’s been asked to- just… don’t. Like, why fight about it, it’s not your task so just ignore her.

If she starts to fight with you or snipe at you, just leave. Walk away. She’s 15, and by definition, irrational. You don’t have to be her friend and you don’t need to respond to her childish taunting- she’s clearly looking for attention, so just do everything in your power to avoid her. 

But definitely get a lock for the door. That’s like… item number 1.",7,0,648,648,"I (F23) fight with my sister (F15) on a regular basis. She is my only sibling and we do not like each other at all. I had to look after her a lot when we were younger because both my parents worked and have been butting heads since. She has been pretty rebelious since she was young and has always had a nasty attitude towards me, and so, I haven't always been the nicest to her.

She absolutely never listens to me and always says that I am not her second mom, and that she doesn't have three parents, which I agree with. Except that she uses it when its not necessary, like when I'm trying to tell her to do things so that my dad doesn't loose his temper when he gets home.

I fight with her the most though over cleaning the kitchen and her taking my stuff. She has started telling me what I will and will not do, which is unacceptable in my opinion. I am not allowed into her bedroom, even if she goes into mine, and I have to clean the kitchen, even if my mother has asked her to do so.

I have begged and pleaded that she stop's taking my stuff but she says that if I don't use it, than she can. Whether it's my makeup or clothing or even my art equipment, she takes it and fights if I try and take it back. She raises her voice so quickly, without me even doing anything, just to get me in trouble.

I found my expensive art equipment in her bedroom the a while back and brought it up in a civil way, but I was told to just leave it because it doesn't matter. I feel so frustrated.

I have started trying to ask my mom for help with these fights, and she will try and stop my sister sometimes, but most of the time I just get fought with and it hurts so much, as if nothing I do matters.

I overheard some insults on instagtam the other day, and my sister and I were fighting that same evening in the kitchen about her not doing what my mom asked her to do. She escalated the situation by deciding to fat shame me, something she does often. I am not what I would consider fat, but I am insecure about my weight, and she is super skinny.

I decided that I had had enough and decided to use an insult I had come accross. I said to her, ""You know what sister's name, there is a tree somewhere out there in the world. This tree's sole purpose in it's life is to replace the oxygen that you waste, go find your tree and apologize to it.""

It ended the argument really quickly and I won't lie, I was pretty happy with myself. My parents said that what I said made me am Asshole. It didn't seem to bother her much because she is unphased by everything, but I feel like it might have been crossing a line.

So AITA?

Best wishes, my friend!!!",5,0,108,108,"Reposting because bot didn't sent me a PM and got removed.  I'm 32yo M. I have a computer degree and work for the Ministry of education in my country. This is a very poor country, and most students have very limited access to technology. I started a program to teach programming and some basic of Linux to students, and has gone well so far. Part of the program also includes creating Kiwix (offline wikipedia) labs and in some schools, creating local clouds so files wont be lost of misplaced. 

In one of the schools there is this student, a 15yo, who from the beginning has shown a lot of interest in learning. He is already doing some nice little projects, but his family is extremely poor so hi does what he can in an old Intel Atom notebook. I thought him how to use what little he can in that notebok using Linux and even upgrading to an SSD.

I have many computers, but I think my favorite one is the Raspberry Pi 400, for those who doesn't know, it's a little ARM based computer built into a keyboard form factor, unaware people just see a keyboard with an unusual amount of ports, when they realize this is a full computer, their minds are blown. This might sound silly for people in the first world, but here this is top notch tech.

So, this one student has some fascination with this Pi. He touches as if it was made of crystal when I let him use it, and together we managed to do some cool stuff.

His birthday was this month, when I knew the date of his birthday, I decided to commit a sin. Buy a full Pi400 kit from a reseller (because these are nearly impossible to buy in official retails right now) and import it. It came right on time, and gave it to him as a birthday present.

He was so excited that started crying, and his family had no idea how to thank me. It melted my heart.

Then I told this to my wife and my 8yo son, and they are mad at me. Apparently he wanted a pi for himself, just failed to communicate it, but they blasted me for giving a Pi to ""a random kid"" and when they saw the Pi arriving home, though I was gonna give it to him. They also told me that the student's family might 100% resell it since they're so poor. My son already has 3 computers, one of them a mid-budget gaming PC. He is also into software but is still too young to do more complex things. I dont know why he suddenly wanted a Pi so much. Neither of them are talking to me.

"AITA for forcing my younger sister to sell our family home after our mom died","Just don't pay the mortgage. Walk away. Your mother wanted her to have the house.  She'll have to sell it, and you'll get your 10% or nothing.  Either way, you lose nothing",1,0,849,849,"So. My mother died last Wednesday. She wrote on the will that the house belongs to Sister1 and if she sells it, 90% of the proceeds go to Sister1 and 10% go to me. Problem.

There's a third child, an estranged sister. Lets call her Sister2. And my mother did not get the will witnessed or notarized which in Florida is needed to uphold a will.

Sister1 has been living in this house for about 10 years now. But every lawyer we've talked to has said that it doesn't matter the house will be split three ways by a judge. 

Sister1 wants to keep the house, even though she can't afford the mortgage. And technically she can't even keep it since it belongs to all 3 of us. She's saying I'm an asshole because I'm not giving up my third of the house to her like our mom wanted. AND for not helping her pay the mortgage she can't afford. She's refusing to start any of the process needed to put the house under the three siblings names and sell it. So we can try to sell it.

If we don't sell it, and she misses any of the mortgage payments the house could be lost and then no one gets anything. I offered to help with the mortgage for 6 months to hopefully sell the house in that time. But she's still saying I'm not doing enough to help her keep the house and should be helping for longer while she continues to drag her feet and prolonged having to split the house three ways.

Next week I'm going to go above her and start the process myself since technically any of the three of us can do it. She hasn't even told Sister2 that she has a claim to the house. She's been trying to find loopholes to cut her off since she was estranged from us. But sorry. Legally she has a right to a third of the house. She also wants us to buy her out, but I don't have that kind of money and I have no problem with the house being split.

I dont understand why I should be expected to give up my legal right to a third, and help her pay the mortgage.

EDIT: Seems like a 30/70 in favor of being the asshole. I'll say this, both Sister1 and I have helped our mom financially and medically. When I came back and it looked like it was turning bad. I had already assumed my mom had left the house to Sister1. And while I get the emotional part of this, every lawyer Sister1 and I have talked to say that Sister2 is getting a third. I refuse to have Sister2 take a third, while Sister1 takes her third and mine while I get nothing. But thanks for the comments and takes

EDIT2: Ppl keep asking about the 90% and 10%. Sister1 is 30, but she lived at home for 10 years with no real bills. She did this straight out of college not because our mom needed any type of care. She only paid $150 in rent for those 10 years, and wasn't even working full time. I do understand why my mom would have wanted her to have the largest share since from her POV Sister1 has no income or honestly anything else. And sister2 getting nothing also make sense as her fallout with our mom was very big. But both Sister1 and I helped with mom's bills and medical care when needed. I even paid for my mom's life insurance for about 2 years. 

It's really Sister1's denial that unless I help with the mortgage she's losing the house that's getting me. Sister2 is getting her third whether we like it or not. Sister1 is not going to be able to keep the house. Her dragging her feet is going to cost me money, not from the house, but because I'm going to have to pay for this mortgage to make sure we dont lose the house before its sold. And even if I do that, Im expected to give up my third?",849,"Historical-Goal-3786","heynoweevee",0

She lived with her father in London where she was educated. She went on to attend university and became a doctor  She married a British man, they moved to America and had a great life. She funded the education of as many of her neices and grand neices as she could. 

When she passed away she left money for every girl relative she could. 

My parents managed to access the accounts that were set up for my sister and I. They used it to pay for my brother's wedding. My sister didn't care because she got married two years out of high school and had no intention of going to college. 

When I graduated I went to the bank to get money for school and it was almost all gone.  There was like $13,000 left. 

I asked my parents about it and they said they had needed the money. I finally found out where the money went. I got furious. I got student loans and moved out. I am a great source of shame to them and I don't give two fucks.

Sadie got pregnant at 18 with Tyler, her boyfriend at that time. Tyler and his sister ended up in a car accident a few months after she announced she was pregnant. He and his sister didn't end up surviving the accident. Sadie was very upset during the rest of her pregnancy. My parents were luckily there to help her out.

Sadie reached out to me a few months ago and asked if we could send her some money every month so she could hire a babysitter for her kids and help my dad.

Edit: damn you autocorrect!",2347,0,29168,29168,"Background: I'm (F23) one of only a few female students in a male-dominated course. Furthermore, I am at a highly prestigious university and I haven't really gotten along with the guys on my course. They are all very competitive and I just don't really enjoy their company - everything turns into a pissing contest, and they definitely take me less seriously because I'm a woman. I stopped interacting with them beyond the mere minimum and choose to hang out with other people. 

Anyway:

I did well in our recent exams (I topped two out of four exams we had so far). Our prof congratulated me during class (I wouldn't have advertised this myself). Ever since then, my interactions with a specific group of male classmates have gotten weird. They're now outright rude and challenge me aggressively in class discussions. We recently had some presentations and one of them chose to do theirs on, to put it simply, ""pretty privilege"" - they specifically pointed to two papers that suggested that pretty female students get overscored in assessments. The other guys in the group snickered and one even gave me a wink. Afterwards, I heard them in the hallway joking that ""they had experience with that themselves"".

I've been seeing a PhD student within our department for a month. He has literally nothing to do with our course. Well, we ran into one of my course mates A together. The next day in class his friend B asked me if ""my boyfriend"" helped me with exams. He said this intentionally loudly and in front of the professor, who heard this. I replied that I don't have a boyfriend (cause he's not my bf), but then B pointed out that he had run into me with the PhD student, making a point to say his name (the prof knows him). I just replied that we're only friends.

They didn't let up - I heard that they discussed this thing in two more classes, in earshot of the professors. Both times they suggested I got help for my exams ( I wasn't even seeing him then). I didn’t confront them, but this has been causing me so much anxiety - even without the exam accusations, I worked hard to get here and I don’t want to be known among the faculty for my dating life.

I raised this issue with my supervisor, without the intention of taking it any further, but I wanted her advice as a woman in academia. She convinced me to let her email their supervisors ""to remind them of proper conduct"" and described their treatment of an ""unnamed female student"". She didn't name me, but they figured it out. They confronted me after class and asked my why I would report their “silly joke“. Apparently, their supervisors are now very cold towards them and less interested in helping. It’s not a formal complaint - only their supervisors know - but one of them, C, said his supervisor writes the reports for his financial aid/scholarship and it was my fault if he lost out on that.

I now feel a bit embarrassed and this was compounded by a friend telling me I took it to far cause C shouldn't lose out on his scholarship. So, reddit - AITA?

I thought maybe I was being culturally insensitive so I googled about it but found nothing. After our talk, the next morning she sent me multiple paragraphs about how I will never understand her culture and that I should just accept her.

For context, my girlfriend has really strict traditional indian parents who are helicopter parents in every sense of the word. They are also super toxic and judgmental.

I felt bad so I gave her our joint refund but didn't tell my husband we had gotten a refund nor that I was keeping it for my mom. He recently had a small financial windfall from an airline that thought they lost his luggage but really didn't. He used the money to pay me back money he owed me but i feel as though half that money should be mine anyway. When we argued about that he asked about our tax refund and i reluctantly him the truth. Now he is angry and says I'm like his ex-wife who always thought what was theirs was hers and what was his was theirs and that he could have used his half of the refund to pay some of his legal expenses. My mom is 93 and has savings plus an income from a job as well as social security but has high rent expenses.  So I think I was in the right. Also even though it was his luggage and he did all the legwork to get a refund from the airline I feel it was like winning the lottery so we should have shared the money. Is he right to feel angry or AITA for thinking that I had the right to use our refund to help my mother and that his windfall should be shared?",50,"Spyryt1970","plaicecover",0

"AITA for expecting my boyfriends parents to treat my daughter the same as his daughters?","YTA. You refuse to see reason as to why you are, but you still are.",14,0,9765,9765,"I (37F) have been dating Martin (39) for what will be 2 years this June. I have a daughter, Scarlett (10) and he has 2 daughters: Miley (13) and Joanna (12). I am a single mother to Scarlett. Her father sends me maintenance each month but has never been an active parent and has never met Scarlett. I also grew up in care so I have no family or anything. Whereas Martin is divorced and shares custody with his ex-wife. Their custody agreement is very flexible with the girls sometimes staying with him or their mum longer or often spending times with both parents together. It really bothered me a lot that he was still good friends with his ex-wife and Martin said if I couldn’t handle the fact he could coparent well and be amicable with his ex then he would end things. I like to think I got over my jealousy and that the girls mother and I get on. 

Anyway since we’ve been dating a while and have started discussing potentially living together I think it’s only really fair that Scarlett is more involved and treated the same as Martin’s daughters by his parents. She met them for the first time a few months ago and has since seen them a few times since but she’s treated virtually like a stranger. At Christmas, Miley and Joanna were spoilt rotten. They got money, gifts, toys, gift vouchers and makeup. All they got Scarlett was an embroidered blanket thing Martin’s mother spent weeks knitting apparently with her name on it, two gift vouchers and a doll.

They’ll take Martin’s girls for overnight sleepovers but my kid is excluded. They say because they don’t know her that well and are uncomfortable looking after her for now. They’ll buy Joanna and Miley sweets or little trinkets and give them a couple of pounds here and there every so often but as for Scarlett, they might only give her one thing and that’s it. It’s not fair for Scarlett.

The last straw was when his parents asked if we would all like to go to Disneyland Paris in Easter with them. They offered to pay for Martin, the girls and said that they could pay for part of mine and Scarlett’s travel expenses, but that I’d have to pay the rest.  

I lost it and told Martin he needs to tell his parents to treat Scarlett like his girls are treated. It’s not fair to her that she has to watch her sisters being spoilt and she isn’t. He lashed out in return and said my parents have been nothing but accommodating to Scarlett by including her in things and getting her stuff at Christmas and so on. He said I’m incredibly selfish to expect his parents to treat my daughter who they barley know as the same as their grandchildren. He said that I’m bitter and jealous and it’s not like we’re married or living together. He used the example of the blanket being a really sweet gift that shows how much his mother cares. He also said it’s perfectly reasonable for his parents to expect me to pay for my own child to go to Disney and that my parents don’t need to pay anything at all for us. He also said I’m raising my daughter to not learn the value of the word no and that she can just be expected to get whatever he wants. He also said that Joanna and Miley are not Scarlett’s sisters, it’s never been emphasised they were and they do not view Scarlett as that. He said that I need to ‘get your arse in gear and realise nothing is being done to discriminate against or exclude Scarlett.’

AITA?

ETA: I view Joanna and Miley as bonus daughters, hence why Scarlett calls them her sisters. Joanna and Miley do not view me as a mother figure in anyway, only as ‘dad’s girlfriend.’ It really hurts but i don’t think im pushy or anything. I just think of us as a blended family unit whereas Joanna and Miley have said im just the woman their dad is dating and Scarlett is nothing to them family wise. I have tried to get them to involve her whenever they’re doing stuff and they outright refuse so they only as they put it ‘tolerate her.’ Martin has chewed me out about this before, claiming I’m trying to insert my daughter in the friendship groups and activities of his daughters and it greatly upsets Scarlett because she just wants to be included. She doesn’t have a lot of friends and I want Joanna and Miley to be her friends.

I have no family and Scarlett’s fathers family aren’t involved. I’ve always tried my best to spoil her myself but it seems only fair since we’re part of Martin’s family now that she’s treated the same as Joanna and Miley.",9765,"emaandee96","bfdaughterdrama",0

"AITA for kicking my friend out after she said I was treating my dog like a ""servant""?","NTA Dogs love having jobs to do!",1,0,6330,6330,"I F27 recently moved into my new house. I have a golden retriever named Nala and she is the sweetest. 

I'm Deaf, too. That bit is important. When I moved in, I had a bit of trouble having flashing light doorbells put in and there was a while I had to go without. My friends and family know to give me a call when they drop by instead of ringing the doorbell but unfortunately I have missed many a package this way. 

For some reason, Nala caught onto this. At one point she began letting me know when someone was at the door. She'd do this in multiple ways. If I was in the living room where I can see the front door,  she'd go and paw at the door, or if I was upstairs she'd come and gently headbutt me  to let me know someone's there. It took me a while to catch on to what she was trying to do, though. 

And now, even though I  have my doorbell installed she still does it. I did not teach her how to do any of this. She just decided to help me out lol.  

I brought a friend over for the first time recently. This is the first time she's met Nala as well. The first thing she comments on is how I named her Nala, because  apparently everyone and their grandma names their golden Nala. Lion King was my favorite movie growing up, sue me. 

Then I showed her a video of Nala pawing at the door because it got a bit awkward after that comment. It's usually a great ice breaker. She laughed and thought it was cute. I showed her another one. She asked me why Nala was doing that and I explained. 

She doesn't say anything for a minute and then goes ""So, she's basically your servant? Is she just here to get the door?"" 

I was thoroughly done with her judgmental ass by that point and I just asked her to leave. She left, but she did message me afterwards saying I was rude as fuck kicking her out after she travelled all the way to see me, and that how else was she supposed to think of my dog with videos like that?",6330,"LookAwayPlease510","day6fan",0

NTA",1,0,4439,4439,"My wife Sara (36F) and I (35M) have an 11 year old daughter named Lily. Lily had begun attending 6th grade in September, but this problem only recently became a major issue. Sara is Indian and makes great dishes that the whole family enjoys, and tends to pack these lunches for Lily as well. She typically packs Lily a rice with dal in a container or something similar, which she had no issues with in elementary school.

However, recently Lily came sobbing to her mom and I about the lunches she took. The kids at school had been making fun of her food, which absolutely made my heart break. I had struggled with the same thing at her age (I come from a Chinese family and would always take homemade food to school too) and when I asked her if she wanted us to report the problem, she begged us not to so she wouldn't be called a ""snitch"" or worse. When Sara heard this, she simply contacted the principal, which I didn't want to resort to at first, and left the issue, telling Lily she wouldn't be buying school lunch and to just ignore the other kids.

The same problem occured every day, Lily would be coming home feeling extremely upset and there were even times Sara would yell at Lily for not even touching her school lunch. We both had talks with Lily about her culture and how she should be proud, have contacted the schools, but the school is ignorant of the issue (they simply had a talk with the parents, and ended it there) and Lily isn't budging. I don't want her to starve, because so many days she doesn't even eat her lunch. I know how brutal middle schoolers can be, and I didn't want Lily to feel insecure or upset even if it meant making her take other lunches, but Sara refuses to make other lunches.

I began to make other lunches for Lily, like sandwiches, or sometimes mac n' cheese, so she'd feel more comfortable eating it in school in front of her classmates as a final resort when nothing else worked. I would take Lily's lunch for myself at work and pack her own lunch early in the morning, which she finished and seemed happier when coming home daily after. However, this only worked for about 2 weeks until Sara found out and was infuriated. She said I was denying Lily her culture and she needed to learn to stop being insulted by other kids, telling me I'm raising Lily to get whatever she wants. Is Sara right? AITA?

EDIT: Bringing this post and topic up tonight, I'll post an update when I can. Hopefully this is enough to convince Sara- if not, I'll do what other comments said and just keep packing Lily's lunch or let her pick.

My father died when I was a baby and for most of my life, it has just been my mom and me. She met my now-stepfather a couple years ago and they got married last summer. 

It has been a huge adjustment to have SF in our family. Mostly because as compared to my mom, he is extremely strict. He convinced my mom that I am spoiled, entitled and need his harsher discipline or else I am never going to make anything of myself. When it was just my mom and me, our home seemed like a warm and loving place but now it feels like a boot camp, which makes sense because SF is ex-military. However, it feels unfair because I am not a bad kid by any means.

I have always gotten pretty much straight As. I do my homework without having to be told and always did whatever chores my mom assigned. I don't talk back or curse and at this point, am not interesting in dating like a lot of my friends are. I don't drink or do drugs and always follow my curfew.

However, SF decided that is not good enough. He demands perfection at school, like 100% on everything or else I get grilled over why I made a mistake. He decided I was a bit chubby so now I have to get up for 5 am runs/boot camp workouts and have to have weekly weight checks (my mom participates in this too because she wanted to lose weight). One of the worst things was that he decided most of my clothes are ""inappropriate."" I do not think they are, I don't wear anything revealing or skintight, but I did favor bright colors. SF decided I was being attention-seeking with my clothes and took away all my bright-colored stuff and replaced it with drab/neutral colors. Again my mom went along with this because he persuaded her that I just had no sense of what was appropriate from now growing up with a father.

Anyway to bring us to the current dilemma, of course St. Patrick's Day is this Friday and everyone at school wears green (or gets pinched). I am not allowed to wear green anymore because of SF's rules. Some friends were talking about what they are going to wear and I mentioned I can't participate this year. So one friend gave me a green T-shirt and suggested I wear it under my black sweater.

I had the T-shirt in my backpack but SF decided to search my backpack (he does random searches of all my stuff, I guess I was just hoping he wouldn't find the T-shirt). Of course he was furious and grounded me for a month. I tried to explain that I just wanted to participate in the tradition and that I was going to be wearing it under other clothes, so at most a small sliver of green would show, but this didn't fly. My mom agreed with the grounding and furthermore said she was incredibly disappointed in me because I have never broken rules and acted out before. I feel awful for disappointing her but also really do feel like the rule is stupid and pointless.

I(35M) was asked by my wife(34F) about the bonus I received at work this year. When I told her about what I got, she asked me if I could loan her $10k. Since she's never asked me for this before I asked what it was for. She said it was to ""help"" her brother buy a house, and she would give him the loan and she would pay me back in monthly installments in $1k. When I asked why she wouldn't just loan him directly, she said it was because she wanted some buffer in her own finances(we have a joint account for bills but don't really mix finances). I had a bunch of questions:

Is this a gift? No, he says he will pay me back.

How would we pay this to him? She would send him the money(He lives in another country).

When is he buying the house? He's just putting a down payment on the build. It's not built yet.

When is he planning on paying you back? He'll pay it back but no idea when.

Wife is adamant that she'll pay me back, and handle it if her brother decides not to pay back. I was really concerned that her brother might not pay her back and I told her as much. My big concern is that he'll pull a ""you're married to a rich American and so I don't have to pay you back"" line on her. There's no real recourse if he doesn't and I don't think that they're really that close. Plus he lives on the other side of the planet(China). I've had a lot of questions and concerns as I've been burned loaning friends/family money in the past and my wife finally just said she wasn't going to loan him money and that she now can't rely on me for financial aid anymore(we share bills, but I pay about 75% of everything as I make more) .

I can probably swing this

I might not be because:

When I said no, they then suggested that I should share some of the money my mother left me with them. She had two life insurance policies, both of which went only to my brother and I. She also left us the house and her car. Basically, everything was split between my brother and I and no one else got anything. My aunts feel that this was wrong and that they, especially A, deserve some of the money. 

My brother blocked them all on platforms when they asked this of him and suggests I do the same, but I feel guilty about cutting off my family. 

But I also feel strongly that if my mother wanted them to get money, she would have left them something. But she didn’t. She chose to leave EVERYTHING to my brother and I. My aunts are saying that my mother did that because she assumed we would share. But I knew my mother. She would have told me if she wanted me to do that. All she said was that she wanted to die knowing that me and my brother would be able to support ourselves. 

So, AITA for not giving money to A or allowing A to stay in my apartment?",2624,"Ok_Research_8379","Ok_Oil_324",0

I don’t get to see them very often as it’s expensive to fly, and they all have kids too so it makes travelling a bit tricky. 

So when I messaged my family introducing my son with his name - Oliver, the general response was positive- however my brother and his wife (both nearly 40) sent me a nasty text and wouldn’t speak to me. I didn’t understand why as it was a short message and didn’t explain anything- just that they were angry about his name. Since they wouldn’t speak to me I rang my sister. She explained that they had taken offence and that they thought the name was too similar to their daughter’s name - Olivia…. She explained they were very angry with us and not willing to speak to us at the moment. I was completely shocked and it’s all been very upsetting. 

I’ve spoken to my parents and my other sister who are also very confused by their reaction.

So I 24m have been having some issues with my family.

To start of I'm getting married this year to my 25f beautiful partner 'Loly' of 3 years. We are both very excited for it but we have been having some issues with my family.

For the background:
I have older sister 'Li' 28, who has always been my parents favorite. It was pretty hard growing up while being constantly bullied by Li but I learned to live with it. I mostly kept it to myself and studied hard so that I could have good grades. Thankfully I was able to move out at the age of 20.

So long story short I haven't been in much contact with my family until now.

A couple months ago I posted abt me and Loly getting engaged on social media. My family saw the post and sent me long messages where they said that they were disappointed how I haven't introduced Loly to them yet and made rude remarks how it was not 'manly' of me let my fiance propose bc she is a woman.
I replied that I will only introduce her to them if they behave. They needed to respect us and keep their rude opinions to themselves. They agreed.

Everything was going pretty well before the topic of wedding dresses came up.

Here's the thing: my fiance doesn't want to wear a dress. She wants to wear a white suit like outfit. She asked my opinion on that and I ofc agreed to it. Bc she should wear whatever makes her feel comfortable on our big day.

However my family were horrified when they found out abt Loly not wanting to wear a wedding dress.
First they begged her to change her mind and when she didn't, they started to make mean comments to her everytime she tried to discuss anything clothing related.
I ofc have asked to them multiple times to cut it out but they behaved only for a short period of time.

And also they complained abt our flower choices,the size of the wedding, the wedding cake, the location, and even abt our music choices.

I'm honestly so frustrated at this point that I don't want them to come to the wedding at all.

My last straw was yesterday when Loly went to dress shopping with a couple of her closest friends.

Li and my mom showed up unannounced there and made mean comments the whole evening. According to Loly's friends my sister and mother fatshamed Loly and called her ugly in every suit that she tried. Then when she did try a wedding dress for peace's sake they acted like over excited teenage girls. They even tried to buy it for her.

Loly came home crying her eyes out and has been upset ever since. And Loly's friends got into a fight with Li and my mom and now both of them have been blowing up my phone demanding apology from Loly.

I am so livid with my family but honestly I'm not proud of my reaction either. I told everybody from my side to get lost bc they are siding with my mom and Li. My family is mad that I'm not letting Li or my mom help my fiance.

I uninvited them all but I still feel pretty bad. They are my family after all.

Now they are mad that I uninvited them.

If your sister feels strongly about Rylee then your mum needs to take into account how your sister feels. Forcing her to do things will never work to create a bond. It will only make your sister feel she is being disregarded in favour Rylee...

Mum needs to see it from your sister's perspective, I would find it very hard to live with a girl who called me fat behind my back and seemed to openly dislike me. And yes, her friends outside of the home could be her positive outlet/safe space. This should be protected. 

My only comment would be, that you all have to live under one roof- if you think a counselling session between all of you could help to at least build some bridges, possibly proposing it would be a good idea (at the mothers expense would be beneficial.)

&#x200B;

  Did Rylee when you first all became a unit try to bond with you both in anyway?",27,0,658,658,"My mom married Jason 2 years ago. My sister and stepsister were both 13f and I was 14m. Dad went MIA when my sister and I were babies. Mom's had a few relationships since then but Jason is the first husband she's had. Jason's daughter is Rylee. Rylee's mom abandoned her when she was a baby too. Her mom died at some point but she only found in November. She'd never met her mom but it was hard on her.

Ever since Rylee found out her mom was dead, my mom has been trying to get her more friends in school. She's friends outside of school. But none actually in school. She wanted my sister to invite Rylee into her friendship group and my sister said no. Rylee and my sister do not like each other. From the first time we met her the two of them have had their issues. It bothers mom that my sister won't let it drop. It's started to get seriously tense between my mom and my sister. Mostly because my sister was hanging out with her friends one day and mom asked them if Rylee could join in (this was outside of school) and my sister's friends said no since Rylee isn't their friend and because my sister doesn't like her. Mom said my sister didn't mind. My sister said she did mind and she would rather stay alone in her room than hang out with Rylee. Mom told her she was turning into a real bully and Rylee was her sister and she should be trying to help her through her difficult time. My sister told mom they didn't like each other and didn't care about each other, so why would either of them want to help the other.

When my sister and I still hung out together after that incident, mom pulled me up and said I should be blasting my sister and including Rylee more. That I should be showing Rylee that loyalty I show my sister. I laughed and asked her why she thought I had loyalty for Rylee. Mom said of course I do, because we're family and she's my younger sister now and how could I not be loyal to her? That I have always been loyal to my sister. I told mom because my sister and I are siblings, close siblings, as well as friends, and I love her. That I don't have to be loyal to Rylee just because I'm loyal to my sister. I told her Rylee might be like a daughter to her now but she's not like a sister to me. She told me I was saying horrible things and I should be better than this. I told her to ask Rylee if she's an only child or has siblings. Mom said Rylee would of course answer that she has siblings. Newsflash: she doesn't but mom and Jason kinda too, like to ignore this and act like Rylee was so desperate to be siblings with us.

Mom told me I should be loyal to both sisters but especially to the one who needs me most right now (Rylee in her eyes). She told me I was not being a good big brother and I should be ashamed of myself for dismissing Rylee the way I do.

AITA?

ETA: Adding some stuff I cut because my post was originally too long.

Rylee and her friends have said my sister is fat. Not to my sister's face but still in the house. I think that's what made her dislike or target my sister. She probably saw her as an easy target and expected her to be all meek and quiet because of her body shape. She doesn't really come for me at all but I have told her to leave my sister alone since hearing her and her friends say that about my sister. I know she hasn't stopped talking about my sister like that either. But I only heard it twice after the first time but I know from how her friends act that they talk shit like that a lot.

Update: from what everyone has said I am clearly NTA. Thank you all for your concern and well wishes. Ana and her family have been blocked and I will no longer be in contact with her. 

It was also brought up to me by another user that their was a similar post posted a few weeks ago from a hosts perspective. This is NOT the same post. My situation happened really recently (allot more recent than whatever the previous post was) I’m shocked to hear this has happened befor, but yeah it’s 💯 not related to ours haha


Finally I’ve had a few comments about my dog being “certified” that I want to clarify. I am not from the US so I’m unsure what your guys process is like, but all I mean is that Bailey has gone through the required testing, training and registration to ensure she is legally aloud to be classified as a service animal :) 


I just want to start by saying I’m pretty sure I’m not the A-hole. But my friend and her family are pretty certain that I am. Please bear with me, I’m just wanting some clarity over this situation to make sure I’m not crazy.

I (24 f) have epilepsy. I have a service dog (fully certified) who is trained to help me with my seizures. I have been diagnosed since a child, and I have had my current dog Bailey for 4 years now and she is the bestest girl around. (Before Bailey I had a previous service dog who we had to retire due to age… but having a service animal is by no means new for me). With her being a service dog she is obviously always with me. 

I have a core friend group who hangs out quite often. My one friend; let’s call her Anna) (also 24f) always makes really weird and almost passive aggressive comments about me and Bailey? Ex; dogs shouldn’t come to restaurants, I’m inconveniencing people, etc. she doesn’t get that I legitimately need her for my own safety. It’s not just for show.

My seizures are really regular; for context I actually get two different kinds. My “small ones” are petit Mal seizures. This essentially just looks like I’m zoning out and staring into space. Quite often people who don’t know me wouldn’t even connect this. My “big ones” are my main concern; these are focal seizures where I fully lose consciousness. This can happen a couple times a day for me so it’s obviously really important that I manage it to the best of my abilities. 

Anyways. Our friend Anna wanted to host a games night/appy night type thing at her house. When we there she lost it on me. She told me it was increadibly disrespectful that I showed up with Bailey without asking for permission first. That I can’t just assume people will be happy with a dog always being around. That I should have just stayed home if I couldn’t handle being out for a few hours without Bailey. I tried apologizing and pointing out that I assumed she knew I was bringing her since I’ve never gone anywhere without her. That set her off more. The guys were finally able to calm her down but her “compromise” was I had to put Bailey in the backyard.

I was an idiot and said fine because I didn’t want to inconvenience anyone more or continue stirring the pot. Bailey went out side and I returned inside with my friends.

"AITA for not giving my wife a ""loan"" so she can help her brother buy a house?","NTA

From her unwillingness to further discuss the potential issues, it sounds like she is very aware of the issues, she just wants to do it anyway.  She wants to make this big gesture of ""loaning"" her brother $10k.  She knows he is unlikely to pay it back.  But she still wants to do it.  That's not the worst thing in the world.  My mother has far more money than her sister, and has gifted her a lot of money over the years.  She can afford to do so and is happy to do so.

It sounds like your wife wants to gift money to her brother, but cannot afford to do so.  You can.  So she has come up with this plan for a loan from you, so she can gift her brother and eventually pay you back.

This is a communication issue.  You are not the AH for refusing to go along with an obviously faulty plan.  But I can't say who is to blame for the communication problem.  She is the one failiing to be honest (perhaps even with herself). But maybe that is because she knows your feelings on the issue, and doesn't feel safe being honest with you.

Your whole post is very focused on the fact that you don't think he will repay her.  You don't seem to worry that she won't pay you back.  Just that she will be paying you with her own funds, not her brother's.  But that is her risk to take.  Especially if you have separate finances, which it appears you do.

I think you need to reframe this conflict in your head.  Your wife wants to GIVE her brother $10k, and is asking you to loan her the money to do so.  She will pay you back.  You don't agree with her choice to give her brother $10k.  But it doesn't truly affect you, beyond being out the piddling interest of one year on $10k.  So is this a habitual problem, with your wife gifting money, that you are justified in controlling?  Or is this just an agree to disagree, and you help your wife out this once?  That's a question between the two of you.",-1,0,1204,1204,"Throwaway account b/c family reads reddit.

I(35M) was asked by my wife(34F) about the bonus I received at work this year. When I told her about what I got, she asked me if I could loan her $10k. Since she's never asked me for this before I asked what it was for. She said it was to ""help"" her brother buy a house, and she would give him the loan and she would pay me back in monthly installments in $1k. When I asked why she wouldn't just loan him directly, she said it was because she wanted some buffer in her own finances(we have a joint account for bills but don't really mix finances). I had a bunch of questions:

Is this a gift? No, he says he will pay me back.

How would we pay this to him? She would send him the money(He lives in another country).

When is he buying the house? He's just putting a down payment on the build. It's not built yet.

When is he planning on paying you back? He'll pay it back but no idea when.

Wife is adamant that she'll pay me back, and handle it if her brother decides not to pay back. I was really concerned that her brother might not pay her back and I told her as much. My big concern is that he'll pull a ""you're married to a rich American and so I don't have to pay you back"" line on her. There's no real recourse if he doesn't and I don't think that they're really that close. Plus he lives on the other side of the planet(China). I've had a lot of questions and concerns as I've been burned loaning friends/family money in the past and my wife finally just said she wasn't going to loan him money and that she now can't rely on me for financial aid anymore(we share bills, but I pay about 75% of everything as I make more) . I've offered alternatives but wife shut it down. Now she's mad and isn't really talking to me. She says that she doesn't want to talk about it anymore. AITA here?

I think I might be because:

I can probably swing this

Wife is guaranteeing it.

I might not be because:

It's a bad idea to loan money to family.

There's no recourse if it isn't paid back.

* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 1 & 2
* Tenchu: Stealth Assassin
* Metal Gear Solid 1-4
* Condemned: Criminal Origins & Bloodshot (esp in VR!)
* Splinter Cell
* Syphon Filter
* Silent Hill 1 & 2
* Jade Empire (one of old school Bioware's best games)
* Fear Effect (unique, adult PS1 game that was 4 discs lol)
* Dino Crisis

I can think of a few others I'd love to be remade but those are probably my top 10. Some others I'd love to see brought back or remade would be the Driver series, Black (one of the best shooters on Xbox/PS2 and way ahead of its time), NFS Underground 2, the Killzone series, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, Def Jam: Fight for New York (probably the most fun I ever had playing a fighting game & the music was great), Fable series, Parasite Eve, Beyond Good & Evil (weren't we supposed to get a sequel ages ago?), Shenmue, Fight Night series, Star Wars: Jedi Outcast and The Force Unleashed, Half Life series, Prince of Persia, GTA: San Andreas/Vice City and Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. So those are all the games that I believe are deserving of being brought back into the current generation or deserve remakes of the original games, if not entirely new games. 

I can't even imagine how sick the Condemned games would be in VR, they're literally *perfect* for it; first person melee combat, horror, creepy af atmosphere and cool detective/investigation mechanics. And I can't imagine how amazing Dino Crisis or Fear Effect could be with today's graphics and tech. So I'm curious what everyone else thinks are games deserving of being remade, and could actually be successful. Like I'd love a remake of Indigo Prophecy or Wild 9 but I know they likely wouldn't be commercially successful so I didn't even put em on the list. I'm hoping this post blows up and some game devs see it and recognize how much money could be made with remakes of some of these titles. Tenchu, KotOR, MGS, Silent Hill and Splinter Cell would all pretty much be guaranteed cash cows imo. Anyway, thanks for coming to my Ted Talk!",0,"OrnRed1988","James_Skyvaper",0

From what I understand, they made that deal because the girl didn't want to abort but also didn't want to take care of the kid, and my friend's family didn't want the baby to go into adoption. They ""punished him"" by making him take care of the baby by himself. They helped him financially until he finished high school, but the parenting job was supposed to be done by him alone.

You've made yourself very clear with both of them, and then tried to hand hold all their meetings and situations.",5,0,5,5,"My friend of 7 years (40M) and of 14 years (35F) live in the same city, happily married to different people, strangers to each other until last year. They both love going dancing. Since 35F is always busy and has few friends, when I visit her city, I go out with her. 

Last year, i introduced her to some of my friends - we went drinking and dancing, including 40M. The whole time 35F kept getting extra touchy with 40M, and he maintained distance. She confided to me that she finds him too hot to stay away. I warned 40M to be careful, because him reciprocating her attention even in the slightest would mess the dynamics. He said of course, she's your friend, I'd never do something to embarass you. Not to mention he's happily married to a lovely woman. That night, 35F, 40M and I were to ride back home together (as we live closeby), and she repeatedly tried to get rid of me by saying why don't you go home with the others (they live on the opposite end of the city) in an attempt to go home with 40M. But he saw through that and snubbed that. I warned him again, and also told her that's not cool.

This year, while visiting her, she mentions in front of my partner, her partner, and a couple of other friends that ""your friend 40M messaged me the other night that he's in the area"". Me - cool, did you meet up? She rolls her eyes, says sarcastically, no he said he wanted to hang out with my child. Me- oh nice, did you? She, sarcastic again - are you mad? Then I let it go as her husband started to get uncomfortable.

Cut to a few days after the incident. I talk to 40M, I mention how she announced his attempt to meet her in a loaded way in front of her partner and several others. And he says that a few months before that, 35F had sent him some pics of hers (I asked to be spared the details of what kind of pics) to which 40M says he had replied with, Nice! He admits he was in the area when he texted her, it was afternoon and not night, and maybe he looked forward to the attention, but also genuinely messaged her knowing that it's a weekend, so if he came by to hang out with her kid, her husband would be home too and it would be ok.

He apologized that since he and I chat often about life, he should have told me that 35F and he were now on chatting terms. And that he understands how I felt blindsided when she accused ""my male friend"" of having inappropriately asked to come to her house under the guise of meeting her kid.

Now I'm feeling angry that he didn't know any better, despite my warning, and that he succumbed to her attention. Which in turn caused me to feel embarassed before 35F's husband, who is also my husband's friend. I am much closer to 40M than to 35F because of several other toxic traits she tends to display now and then, so i would never confront her, nor is it my place to do so but i am feeling hurt and betrayal from 40M, and don't feel like talking to him though He has apologized to me.

My husband was divorced from my stepdaughter's mom. She was 8 when my husband and I became serious and my son was still a baby. Not long after my stepdaughter's mom died. My husband and I had talked about marrying before she died and we delayed it for a couple of years to allow my stepdaughter time to grieve and adjust to the changes in her life. This was with the help of therapy, of course. We knew a child who lost someone so close would need extra help.

Now my stepdaughter is 20, my son is 12 and our children together are 7, 6 and 4.

So what happened here is my stepdaughter and her boyfriend recently moved into a house together. She asked for help setting up their dining room and we all went over to help her. Her house was covered in photos. The landing had them, living room, kitchen, etc. There was not a single photo of her siblings in the house, or me, but it was not seeing one of the kids that led to this. She had her parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, her cousins, and friends. But there was no sign of the kids anywhere. All of the photos with her dad were older ones, from before we met. My 12 year old, 7 and 6 year old's noticed because they were excited to look around her house. I couldn't help but notice because her boyfriend had so many of his siblings and because there were some, what felt like deliberate choices, to make sure she used photos that didn't contain her siblings. Including extended family photos from years ago with my husband's side that were taken before her dad and I met. And we know she has photos with her siblings.

I always knew she wasn't super crazy about her siblings. I always hoped as she got older she would feel love for them. But it feels like she doesn't think of them as family or as special enough to be included. The three kids who noticed were hurt. My husband tried to assure them it was likely an oversight on her part and he called her the next day to ask. She said she had only wanted photos with people she considered family and she didn't consider us family.

We were all invited to her housewarming party. But the kids did not want to go. My husband and ILs were shocked and said they had to go of course. I argued that they didn't and I told him I would stay home with them. They argued back to me that the kids needed to be. I said they did not need to be there and I wouldn't force them to go when they already feel hurt. My husband and ILs think I'm unreasonable.

For the past 7 years, I’ve been staying in an apartment my mother bought. She always told me that when she died, she wanted me to have it because she worked so hard to ensure  I always had somewhere to live. So when she died, she left me the apartment in the will. My brother has no issue with this, he makes more than enough of his own money and actually owns an apartment in the same building. 

However, my aunts (A and B) have an issue with this. A has had money issues for as long as I’ve known her and my mother was always helping her out with money when she was alive. B is financially stable, but in no position to help A. They both think that since I make enough money to be able to rent a place, I should let A stay in the apartment and rent my own because that’s what my mother would have wanted. 

I said no, stating that my mother wanted me to have a place of my own. I am currently saving all the money I would have used on rent and intend to buy my own house when I have enough saved. 

When I said no, they then suggested that I should share some of the money my mother left me with them. She had two life insurance policies, both of which went only to my brother and I.

"AITA for lightly scolding a 12-year-old because the birthday gift he gave to my son was broken?","Hoo boy. Wouldn't wanna be in your shoes today. You were unnecessarily cruel to a 12 year old kid who was kind enough to buy your kid present. 

Would you have liked it if the situation were reversed and it had happened to your own child? 

It was unbelievably rude and ungracious of you to do this.

Edit ... Reread that the kid bought the present himself",1,0,510,510,"Recently, we had a birthday party for my (32f) son (7m) He invited some of his classmates and our neighbour's kids who he's close with. One of them was a 12-year-old boy who brought a doll-type thing which glowed and made noises if you pressed a button. We opened the present later after the party, and even though my son was happy to receive it, I noticed that the toy had a cracked shoulder.

The next day, when the boy came to play with my son and the other kids, I asked him who brought the gift, and he said he did it. I showed him the broken part and lightly scolded him. I simply told him that if he was going to spend money buying something, he should've checked the thing. I gave it back to him and told him to ask the store to replace it since it's broken. I thought it was a good life lesson and that he'd remember this. It would help him when he buys something later on. It would teach him not to waste his money.

However, later that evening his mom called me and told me that I was very rude to her son. She said and I quote ""if someone gives you a gift, you just appreciate it and don't say anything even if it's not that good, especially when it's a kid"" Turns out, he bought it with his own pocket money, and he put a lot of thought into it. He did replace the gift, but he has stopped coming to play with my son. AITA? I genuinely didn't mean to upset him. I didn't even really scold him. I talked to him very gently and only explained it to him.",510,"existential_tourist1","fucksocietyfml",0
"AITA for finally telling my brother the truth, but throwing my parents under the bus to do so?","The best advise my father gave me was never do business with friends or family. And here is another example of why…. ESH",1,0,2110,2110,"AITA for finally telling my brother the truth, but throwing my parents under the bus to do so?

I (36m) used to run a company with my (35m) brother and both my parents. It was supposed to be the dream of the sons taking over the family business. I had the ability to work in every department, so over the course of the last 10 years I progressed to running the company. My brother, who worked harder than anyone else, floundered with any real responsibility. He was the ultimate task doer, but ask him to manage anyone or anything, and it would be a dumpster fire.

My parents would protect my brother by tying my hands behind my back in regards to saying anything bad to my brother about the quality of his work, or how he was failing at being a manager. My parents did not want his feelings to be hurt. My brother would get moved to a different department, or have his job description change so he wasn't in charge of anything that would hurt the company. They would never tell him he wasn't doing his job right, they would never tell him he sucked at his job. It was easier for  them to lie to him, so they could avoid any conflict or hurt feelings.

I was complicit in this. I kept up the lies, I played the game. Resentments grew. My brother was still getting paid the same as me, I was running the company, at this point he was basically still in a entry level position. So 2 years ago I started a different company and left the family one. Less than a year later, my parents asked me to come back. I accepted on the condition that my brother would be bought out of the company. They agreed.

So with my brother being bought out, I am now running the company solo, we gave him a group of our customers that he now services under his own company name, life is good, or so I though.....

I found out by one of my employees, that my brother has been stealing product out of our warehouse. They were under the impression that we had some sort of deal worked out with me because we were family. NOPE..... He was just plain stealing.

So when I confront my brother, he admits to stealing, but went off on this rant on how I never respected him, that I was the biggest asshole because I was mean, and on and on. So then and there I decided to stop lying, and essentially told him all of the lies from the last 10 years. How he got the short end of the stick because no one ever told him what he was doing wrong. How our parents just didn't want to hurt his feelings, but knew he couldn't run the company. I was done lying, I just sat there and told the truth.

So my parents are now mad at me because he's mad. Like MAD MAD, and he has gone no contact with them, and they are worried that they wont be able to ever see him or their grandchildren again.

So AITA for finally telling my brother the truth, but throwing my parents under the bus to do so?

EDIT: To add to more information to this story, it was not like my brother was thrown into a situation without training. We provided informal training on how to learn more about the business (Like this is how we do the books, come with me on the jobsite so I can show you this). Formal training both trade specific and management courses. He was not thrown to the wolves, he just never cared to pick it up, or try to step up. 

I left the company because of the toxic environment and all of the built up resentments.

I came back to the company because my parents retirements are tied to the company and without a son to run it or a sale, they would have lost everything. I still run the other company I started.

Last, I knew I was an asshole for what I did to my brother. When I told him the truth, I was also apologizing to him for my part in all of it. I was asking if I was the asshole for throwing my parents under the bus in the truth/apology.",2110,"Pleasant-Dust6668","poolmoney1",0

I live far away from my family so mainly communicate over a family group chat. I don’t get to see them very often as it’s expensive to fly, and they all have kids too so it makes travelling a bit tricky. 

So when I messaged my family introducing my son with his name - Oliver, the general response was positive- however my brother and his wife (both nearly 40) sent me a nasty text and wouldn’t speak to me. I didn’t understand why as it was a short message and didn’t explain anything- just that they were angry about his name. Since they wouldn’t speak to me I rang my sister. She explained that they had taken offence and that they thought the name was too similar to their daughter’s name - Olivia…. She explained they were very angry with us and not willing to speak to us at the moment. I was completely shocked and it’s all been very upsetting. 

I’ve spoken to my parents and my other sister who are also very confused by their reaction. My sister-in-law has said to them that they might be willing to allow us to use Oliver as a middle name but if we use it as a first name that that will essentially lead to an end of relationship between us and them. 

I don’t feel I have to justify or ask permission for naming my son and feel they are being controlling with double standards. They’ve never asked anyone permission for naming their children, nor have any of my other siblings… We have different last names and there’s nearly 5 years between their Olivia and my Oliver, not to mention we live in different countries.

For context: I (21F, British) have lived alone since I was 19 after being kicked out by my abusive mother, she wasn’t the best then but it’s getting better now. Because of this, my brother (17M) has been no-contact with her since he was 14. It’s been a bumpy road but we‘re both on the way to recovery finally after a couple years. Anyway, recently my brother has come to live in my apartment due to a falling out between him and our father (I don’t know the details). It’s a one bedroom apartment as it’s the only thing I can afford with my pay grade which means he’s been sleeping on the pull-out couch in my living room for around a month.

At first, it was going okay, but now when I come home from University and work, I find clothes thrown around on the floors. He eats everything out of my fridge when he gets home from sixthform to the point where I’m having to hide some of my food around my bedroom to try and keep snacks for myself. On multiple occasions, I’ve come back from a late night shift at around 9PM to see him and his friends drunk and high on my couch, swearing unlike anything I’ve ever heard before. I try to make them leave, but my brother just gets up in my face (He is 6’3 and I am 5’7) and I leave them be as I am not one for confrontation — never have been and probably never will be.

Honestly, him having friends over wouldn’t be a problem for me if he wasn’t getting drunk and causing a racket, but many of my things like vases have already been smashed by him and I‘m not in the place to be able to afford replacements at the moment. I also have my final Uni exams in May so really need to sleep during the nights, but his frequent meet-ups with his friends are really affecting me mentally and my ability to keep my sleeping schedule.

I’ve asked him on multiple occasions to keep his space clean and to stop brining his friends over, at least until I finish my exams, but he just won’t listen. The same with the food, I ask if he can bring his own food home on his way back and he gets really defensive and says ‘why can’t you?’ ‘You’re my big sister, you should provide for me’ ect. I’ve spoken to my father, they’re in the ‘I won’t speak to him until he apologises’ phase, which is really annoying so he can’t go back there until they sort their business out, but I don’t know how long that will be.

I feel really guilty asking my brother to do all of this stuff, but I’m simply not able to hold up a two person household by myself yet. As for now, money really isn’t one of my main concerns, but more the stress and anxiety I feel every night after a long day realising I have to cook for my younger brother when I get in.

Me and my brother (35M) are her only children. For the past 7 years, I’ve been staying in an apartment my mother bought. She always told me that when she died, she wanted me to have it because she worked so hard to ensure  I always had somewhere to live. So when she died, she left me the apartment in the will. My brother has no issue with this, he makes more than enough of his own money and actually owns an apartment in the same building. 

However, my aunts (A and B) have an issue with this. A has had money issues for as long as I’ve known her and my mother was always helping her out with money when she was alive. B is financially stable, but in no position to help A. They both think that since I make enough money to be able to rent a place, I should let A stay in the apartment and rent my own because that’s what my mother would have wanted. 

I said no, stating that my mother wanted me to have a place of my own. I am currently saving all the money I would have used on rent and intend to buy my own house when I have enough saved. 

When I said no, they then suggested that I should share some of the money my mother left me with them. She had two life insurance policies, both of which went only to my brother and I. She also left us the house and her car. Basically, everything was split between my brother and I and no one else got anything.

I have a computer degree and work for the Ministry of education in my country. This is a very poor country, and most students have very limited access to technology. I started a program to teach programming and some basic of Linux to students, and has gone well so far. Part of the program also includes creating Kiwix (offline wikipedia) labs and in some schools, creating local clouds so files wont be lost of misplaced. 

In one of the schools there is this student, a 15yo, who from the beginning has shown a lot of interest in learning. He is already doing some nice little projects, but his family is extremely poor so hi does what he can in an old Intel Atom notebook. I thought him how to use what little he can in that notebok using Linux and even upgrading to an SSD.

I have many computers, but I think my favorite one is the Raspberry Pi 400, for those who doesn't know, it's a little ARM based computer built into a keyboard form factor, unaware people just see a keyboard with an unusual amount of ports, when they realize this is a full computer, their minds are blown. This might sound silly for people in the first world, but here this is top notch tech.

So, this one student has some fascination with this Pi. He touches as if it was made of crystal when I let him use it, and together we managed to do some cool stuff.

His birthday was this month, when I knew the date of his birthday, I decided to commit a sin. Buy a full Pi400 kit from a reseller (because these are nearly impossible to buy in official retails right now) and import it. It came right on time, and gave it to him as a birthday present.

He was so excited that started crying, and his family had no idea how to thank me. It melted my heart.

Then I told this to my wife and my 8yo son, and they are mad at me. Apparently he wanted a pi for himself, just failed to communicate it, but they blasted me for giving a Pi to ""a random kid"" and when they saw the Pi arriving home, though I was gonna give it to him. They also told me that the student's family might 100% resell it since they're so poor. My son already has 3 computers, one of them a mid-budget gaming PC. He is also into software but is still too young to do more complex things. I dont know why he suddenly wanted a Pi so much. Neither of them are talking to me.

I was really young when we first started dating and the nagging of my MIL, wanting us to have kids early, always bothered me. I took my complaints to my fiancé but he dismissed me saying that i should ""understand his mother's ways"". I didn't get her hopes up about me having kids, because i always said that i wanted to mature enough to be able to raise a kid.

As i said, i just dismissed her nagging, until last week.

My fiancé came home from work (that btw he works with his mother), saying: ""I was with mom all that in the office,and after she told me some things i came to the conclusion that you should stop taking your birth control pills"". Unbelievable. Didn't even want to argue about something this ridiculous.

Time passed and we didn't touch this issue anymore.

The weekend came, and we went to visit my MIL's house, she took me to her room saying she needed to have a word with me and my fiancé.

She sat down on the bed and said: ""I had a discussion with Luiz (my fiancé's name), and i told him about my concern with you guys not having children at the appropriate age. Who knows if you're going to be able to have children with this disease of yours? As for now, he will no longer allow you to buy the birth control pills per my request""

(He never buyed them for me, i work 9 hours a day and everything i buy for myself comes from my money)

About ""my disease"": It's a disease that all the women in my father's side had: Uterus Cancer. My great-great-grandmother passed due to it, my great-grandmother too and my grandma had it after giving birth to my father, but the doctors took the uterus out before the cancer could spread further. My grandma was always cautious with me. Never had any issues, and i go to the gynecologist 2 times a year to do exams.

 I got enraged, and looked at my fiancé who was sitting beside her, and he just averted his eyes.

""you will regret leaving the thoughts of having kids after your graduation, because god time is now and i got a revelation from the pastor that one of my family members is going to try to have kids and it's not gonna be able to. I'm sure that person is you, and i'm worried for my son. I can't leave this marriage be if your thoughts don't align.""

When she said that last line, i exploded, saying ""Are you so desperate for me to sit on your son's cock and have a baby so what? It's not your business if we're having kids or not or if we're having sex or not, this must be a joke"".

The argument escalated but i don't remember much because i got so enraged that i started trembling and had to go home to calm myself down alone, as i left my fiancé there.

When he came home, he was pissed off saying that i disrespected his mother and that if i didn't apologise he would consider breaking off the engagement. Honestly am not making any effort to set things straight as i'm very offended by everything she said.

To be brief; my husband is going to Miami with a friend for a long weekend. I think this is great and supported the idea of this trip since the beginning. 

We have a 17 year old daughter (his biological child, but I've been around since she was 5 years old. I love her to pieces.) He told me tonight that he informed our daughter 'Elisa ' that she could not leave the house nor stay overnight at any of her friends houses while he is on vacation. This was news to me as well (he mentioned this at dinner with all of us in the same room.)

Understandably upset, Elisa asked why and what had she done  to be punished. My husband said she had done nothing, but she needed to be home the entire time because that was the only way he could trust that I would stay home as well. He said he didn't trust me not to ""stay out and party all weekend"" unless Elisa was home and I had to take care of her. My party days are long behind me but he brings them up constantly, many many years after the fact.

Aside from the logic being incredibly flawed here, I'm frankly disturbed by the fact he will punish her and jam up her extended weekend as a tool to ensure I do what he wants me to do. 

I told him flat out I thought what he did was unfair to Elisa and a little sick. He's now telling me it's my fault he had to resort to this because he can't trust me.

"AITA for not sharing my inheritance?","NTA. Seriously, your aunts parasitized on your mum while she was alive, and know they want to continue parasitize on her inheritance? The nerve and entitlement of these women! Let them earn their own damn money, you don't own them anything beyond what your mother may specifically left them in her will",1,0,2624,2624,"I (25F) recently lost my mother to cancer. Me and my brother (35M) are her only children. For the past 7 years, I’ve been staying in an apartment my mother bought. She always told me that when she died, she wanted me to have it because she worked so hard to ensure  I always had somewhere to live. So when she died, she left me the apartment in the will. My brother has no issue with this, he makes more than enough of his own money and actually owns an apartment in the same building. 

However, my aunts (A and B) have an issue with this. A has had money issues for as long as I’ve known her and my mother was always helping her out with money when she was alive. B is financially stable, but in no position to help A. They both think that since I make enough money to be able to rent a place, I should let A stay in the apartment and rent my own because that’s what my mother would have wanted. 

I said no, stating that my mother wanted me to have a place of my own. I am currently saving all the money I would have used on rent and intend to buy my own house when I have enough saved. 

When I said no, they then suggested that I should share some of the money my mother left me with them. She had two life insurance policies, both of which went only to my brother and I. She also left us the house and her car. Basically, everything was split between my brother and I and no one else got anything. My aunts feel that this was wrong and that they, especially A, deserve some of the money. 

My brother blocked them all on platforms when they asked this of him and suggests I do the same, but I feel guilty about cutting off my family. 

But I also feel strongly that if my mother wanted them to get money, she would have left them something. But she didn’t. She chose to leave EVERYTHING to my brother and I. My aunts are saying that my mother did that because she assumed we would share. But I knew my mother. She would have told me if she wanted me to do that. All she said was that she wanted to die knowing that me and my brother would be able to support ourselves. 

So, AITA for not giving money to A or allowing A to stay in my apartment?",2624,"Imaginary-Fish4277","Ok_Oil_324",0

You handled it badly.",-9,0,2077,2077,"My wife has two sons with her ex-husband (13 & 17), I have two daughters with my ex-wife (10 & 12), and together we have an almost two year old son together. All our kids get along well, and we have a good relationship with each other’s children.

My parents are very doting grandparents to my 3 bio kids but have always been standoffish with my stepsons. There has been lots of little things over the years that have shown how little they care for them. They have never once bought them a birthday present (my wife's parents get my daughter's gifts) and at Christmas they are always given the most pathetic/cheap gift. It's not always bad as there has been times when, my dad in particular, has been good at engaging with them. In November he came with me and the boys to watch a football game and go out for lunch and everybody had a great time.

Last week my mom stayed with us as it was my daughter's 10th birthday. She stayed in the 17 year olds room and he slept on an air mattress in his brother's room. Not only did she never think to thank him, but she also tried banning him from going in the room at all when he occasionally needed to. One morning he knocked on the door to ask if he could go in to grab his sneakers and she said no and wouldn't even pass them to him. I had to intervene and get them myself. Despite this he was nothing but polite to her face. If I listed every passive aggressive thing she said/did to the boys during her stay it would make this post to long.

On Friday, the 13 yo and toddler were playing outside with a basketball. At one point 13 yo threw the ball a little too hard at his brother and knocked him over. My mom had been outside and saw what happened and started to berate the 13 yo and grabbing him hard by the arm. When his mom came outside to see why the baby was crying my mom continued to say foul things about my stepson and called him an awful brother and dangerous to her grandson. When stepson told his mom what he had accidentally done, my mom started raving about him doing it on purpose.

When I got home my stepson was sulking in his room. My wife had told me what had happened, so I went to see him, and we talked. He vented about how my mom had made him feel the whole week and asked me why she hated him and his brother. This made me angry and after talking with my wife, I decided to ask my mom to leave and told her she wouldn’t be welcome back until she corrected her attitude towards my stepsons. Of course, she didn’t take this well and after she argued with me for over an hour she left. Later I got a call from my dad who was livid, he wouldn’t let me explain myself, so I hang up.

I feel I did the right thing to protect my stepsons, but my siblings are also upset with me. They think I’m an ass for treating our mom badly and overreacting.

Hello. I'm sorry, never posted something like this before. 

To be brief; my husband is going to Miami with a friend for a long weekend. I think this is great and supported the idea of this trip since the beginning. 

We have a 17 year old daughter (his biological child, but I've been around since she was 5 years old. I love her to pieces.) He told me tonight that he informed our daughter 'Elisa ' that she could not leave the house nor stay overnight at any of her friends houses while he is on vacation. This was news to me as well (he mentioned this at dinner with all of us in the same room.)

Understandably upset, Elisa asked why and what had she done  to be punished. My husband said she had done nothing, but she needed to be home the entire time because that was the only way he could trust that I would stay home as well. He said he didn't trust me not to ""stay out and party all weekend"" unless Elisa was home and I had to take care of her. My party days are long behind me but he brings them up constantly, many many years after the fact.

Aside from the logic being incredibly flawed here, I'm frankly disturbed by the fact he will punish her and jam up her extended weekend as a tool to ensure I do what he wants me to do. 

I told him flat out I thought what he did was unfair to Elisa and a little sick. He's now telling me it's my fault he had to resort to this because he can't trust me.

"AITA for not using the regular public restroom?","NTA. Because of a traumatic event, you need reasonable public accommodations to use the toilet. This isn't any different than a baby or toddler needing their own type of accommodations (i.e. with the aid of a parent) to use the toilet. You were considerate of others, and you made a reasonable judgment that using the bathroom at that time wouldn't cause anyone else an inconvenience.

Unfortunately, it did. But that's not your fault. The woman should have understood that bathrooms are limited resources, and sometimes require waiting. Waiting sucks. But she needed to be an adult about it. And instead of doing so, she scolded a complete stranger despite not knowing their circumstances. And you're absolutely right: your situation is none of her business.

Perhaps you could have found a family restroom elsewhere, but there's no guarantee that you wouldn't have run into the same situation out there. Plus, there's probably even more people who would want to use the family restroom out in the mall area vs in D&B.

I hope you're able to resolve your trauma and wish you the best of luck. Having a good therapist might help you along. Eventually, you can use the same shitty public toilets we all have to use! Cheers.",379,0,192,192,"First, allow me to set the scene: I was out at Dave & Busters in my local mall (for those who don't know what that is, it's an arcade/restaurant partially aimed at adults but obviously families bring kids too). It was a Monday evening and not particularly crowded, though there were a handful of families with small children there. 

Now, let me give some relevant context: When I was younger, I had a traumatic event happen to me in a public restroom which has resulted in me having anxiety surrounding the use of public bathrooms. it's not *impossible* for me to use them, but it's difficult (I have to very mindfully calm my panic response) and it ends up taking longer than typical to do my business, even just #1.. (sorry if that's TMI, I just want to be thorough in explaining the context)

Ok, now that we have that out of the way...
So I'm at D&B with a friend and have to go to the bathroom. I know they have one of those 'family' restrooms that is just a large single room/stall where you can lock the door and not worry about anyone else being in there, so I try the door and no one is using it so I go ahead and lock the door behind me and just as I sit on the toilet, the door handle jiggles. damn. ""occupied!"", I call out & just hear a muffled grunt in response. This, unfortunately, does kick in a bit of an anxiety response, but I calm myself & do what I gotta do - all in all, I was in the bathroom for just under 7 minutes (i noticed the time when I sat down and looked again after washing my hands)

When I come out, there's a woman waiting with her toddler who, upon seeing me exit alone, starts going off on me and telling me I have no business using a family restroom, especially in an establishment where there's clearly always going to be families around who may need it.

I just apologized and said that it was available and there weren't very many families in the facility at the time anyway and explained that I had a good enough reason for using it myself. She scoffed at this and asked what excuse could *possibly* have for taking away a facility (albeit briefly) from the families it was created for in the first place.

I don't really feel that my trauma is anyone's business so I told her, as calmly as I could muster, that my reasons are none of her business and either way, it's available now, so go ahead and use it. And then I walked away. I was feeling a little shook up and when I mentioned it to my friend, he agreed that I was kinda the AH cuz I could have just gone out into the mall area and probably found a family restroom to use out there.. (there were maybe 20, at most, people milling about the rest of the mall area)

So they made my husbands oldest brother (the one who wanted the dog) take a leash for a walk everyday, 3 times a day. They said if he could keep it up diligently for a month he could get a dog.

My daughter (10) wanted a puppy for her birthday so my wife and I went to a shelter and picked a puppy for her, we made it very clear that she had to be responsible for it. That means that she'll have to clean after him, feed him and checking his water bowl, etc. We would hire a trainer and would take him to the vet when it was needed, but besides that she had to take care of it. 

During the first month things were okay, she did as she promised. But now (over two months since she got the puppy) she complains about having to clean when the dog poops or pees on the floor and when she had to take care of him. This week she reached the last straw because she forgot to give him water, my wife had to fill his bowl because she didn't do it. 

I told her this is enough because a dog is not a toy and she promised to be responsible. I contacted some friends/ family and asked them if they wanted the puppy. Finally a coworker said she wanted it and I took him to her house. 

My daughter is very sad now but I think she needs to learn a lesson here. My parents told me I was being unfair because deep down I knew that my daughter was gonna fail in being responsible and I set her up for failure. They think that as a dad I need to teach them but not punish them the first time they make a mistake. Are they right? I think that that's a good advice if it was something else, but a dog is a living animal and it deserves someone who truly cares for it.",896,"Cosima-Arcana","No-Possibility6020",0

I have a golden retriever named Nala and she is the sweetest. 

I'm Deaf, too. That bit is important. When I moved in, I had a bit of trouble having flashing light doorbells put in and there was a while I had to go without. My friends and family know to give me a call when they drop by instead of ringing the doorbell but unfortunately I have missed many a package this way. 

For some reason, Nala caught onto this. At one point she began letting me know when someone was at the door. She'd do this in multiple ways. If I was in the living room where I can see the front door,  she'd go and paw at the door, or if I was upstairs she'd come and gently headbutt me  to let me know someone's there. It took me a while to catch on to what she was trying to do, though. 

And now, even though I  have my doorbell installed she still does it. I did not teach her how to do any of this. She just decided to help me out lol.  

I brought a friend over for the first time recently. This is the first time she's met Nala as well. The first thing she comments on is how I named her Nala, because  apparently everyone and their grandma names their golden Nala. Lion King was my favorite movie growing up, sue me. 

Then I showed her a video of Nala pawing at the door because it got a bit awkward after that comment. It's usually a great ice breaker. She laughed and thought it was cute. I showed her another one. She asked me why Nala was doing that and I explained. 

She doesn't say anything for a minute and then goes ""So, she's basically your servant? Is she just here to get the door?"" 

I was thoroughly done with her judgmental ass by that point and I just asked her to leave. She left, but she did message me afterwards saying I was rude as fuck kicking her out after she travelled all the way to see me, and that how else was she supposed to think of my dog with videos like that?",6330,"cayminquinn","day6fan",0

So I have a small business of my own ( bakery ) and I have grown on my own for the past 4 years. Safe to say I have a built a decent customer base.

Recently, both of my sisters have opened their own small businesses ( hair accessories ) and they’ve been asking me to advertise their goods on my social media to my customers. Of course I said yes, because I wouldn’t mind helping getting their name out there, so I advertised their products a few times.

Now whenever they get new products to sell, they pester me to advertise their new things and constantly remind me when I forget. They said they already have social media pages for their business but they want me to advertise since I have a lot of customers on my social media. I don’t want to do it every day and all the time because it gets annoying and it interferes/clashes with my business since we’re selling completely different things. I even gave them advice on how and where to sell. 

I want their businesses to grow, but I don’t want this to interfere with my own business. They get annoyed with me whenever I don’t advertise their things for them.

WIBTA for not advertising their business anymore?

We live very close to each other and I accompany them on their walks a few times a week. Emily likes to act like she and her dog are having actual conversations, which is fine at home, but weird in public. I asked her a few times before not to do it on our walks, but she just finds it funny.

Yesterday we sit down on a bench in the park in the middle of our walk and her dog wanted us to continue walking so he was grunting at us. Emily took this as an opportunity to pretend to have a conversation with him.

By conversation I mean something like this:

Emily: XY said this to me yesterday, can you imagine?

Dog: grunts 

Emily: Right?! That's what I said too.

Dog: grunts

Emily: I'm so happy you are on my side... and so on, and so on.

People walking by us were laughing at us and I asked Emily to stop, but she didn't. So I told her it's embarrassing and left her there.

That isn't the reason my parents divorced, it was just a joke about a coincidence, but she said it was a horrible thing to say about my sisters.

My grandmother then joked that it was the opposite, because it implied my dad wanted daughters and only stayed with a woman long enough to get one, so as long as she doesn't have another kid or only has sons he'll stick around waiting for a girl. We both started laughing, and my dad's wife stared at us silently and then got up and left the room. At this point I started to wonder if I crossed a line.

I hate this situations, forcing a relationship almost never works. 

Had SIL tried to be civil , there would have been every chance that OP naturally began to care for the stepchildren and included them in the family.
Instead he tried to force it and I bet he complains about to the other children making it even more noticeable. 

It very sad that those children don’t have extended family to care for them, but that is definitely SIL fault, and not OP’s responsibility to fix.",1,0,138,138,"I lost my youngest daughter Joy a decade ago. She left behind her husband and two children who are now 15 and 16 years old. My daughter was very close to her dad and me and when she was at her sickest, she begged us to stay in the kids lives and make sure they always knew she loved them and that we were her family just as much. She mentioned how worried she was that her husband would encourage them to forget her and would try to replace her for them with a new woman. She asked that we leave anything we might have left her to her children. We assured her we would never let the relationship end and that we would make sure they had a good life and would remember her always.

Eight months after she died her husband moved his now wife into their home. She had a baby with someone else and was also expecting a baby with someone. At that point he did attempt to make it a package deal where we could not see our grandchildren without treating his now stepchildren as our grandchildren and that we were to treat all future children of his the same. Otherwise we would need to be cut out to give our grandchildren the chance to form the new family bonds without interference from us. That they deserved the chance to have another mother and only see the new children as true siblings.

Their lawyer told them we would have a case to get grandparents visitation. We also sought advice on if we were denied access, if we could obtain that. We were told given our close relationship with the children it would be easy to get access through the courts. This led to us getting minimal access but it was all that was needed because our grandchildren were glad to see us and their aunts, uncles and cousins.

In the last few years my former son in-law has found himself estranged from his own family and his wife's family are also no longer in the picture and he has 6 children (not counting my grandchildren) in his home with no family or support outside of him and his wife. Now that my grandchildren are teenagers they seek to spend more time with us and their lives have benefitted from it. We admittedly spoil them more than some would like because of the circumstances but they are wonderful children. Their father confronted me recently about his other children and how they have no extended family and are suffering seeing their siblings being spoiled. He also said we had already come between our grandchildren and their siblings because they are not close and have never asked for their siblings to be part of the extended family they have. He told me I owe it to his children to step in and give them love and some of the same spoiling. I told him I did not owe his children anything, and that I would never forgive him for what he attempted to do before. He told me I was cold hearted and callous.

Part of me wonders if he's right because the children are innocent. And even though I have never considered them family, they are still young and nothing to do with my former SILs actions.

I (50F) have a daughter (19F) who now goes to school in another state. She is in a long-distance relationship with her boyfriend (19M). For storytelling purposes, we will say my daughter is Rachel and her boyfriend is Mike.

Rachel is a super busy student, but she somehow manages to work 20 hours a week to make enough money to support herself. I honestly couldn't be more proud of her. She has amazing grades, has found an activity she really likes, and seems to take good care of herself. Mike also goes to college, makes good grades from what I hear, and is in the process of getting a research job. 

My daughter has a huge heart, and always wants to make sure she gets to see Mike. Recently, with her college refund checks, she has been paying for his flights to come to see her and trying to pay so they can do nice things. I have warned her against this multiple times, and I feel like my claims fall on deaf ears. He finally has a job, but I am still wary of the amount of money they spend on seeing each other. 

This past week was her spring break and I was so happy to catch up and hear about her and Mike's trip to Chicago when they went up together for a weekend. She told me how expensive it was and how she ended up getting a credit card without consulting me first. She told me she was planning a trip in 2024 to Mexico for her and Mike and I immediately said she can't go. She told me the decision was ultimately up to her and Mike, and that I couldn't keep her from going. I told her she was being financially irresponsible again and she told me she didn't care what I thought. Her debt is being paid off with a solid plan to pay it off in three months. 

We argued back and forth and I told her she would not have my support if she went on this trip she said that was fine and she didn't care. Mike and his family support her.

&#x200B;

I know I shouldn't have yelled at her, but I love and care about my child. I don't want to see her go into debt over some silly trip to Mexico. Some of my friends say I'm the asshole for trying to tell a grown working woman how to spend her money, but some others understand I just don't want to see her in debt.

Upon hiring, we agreed to specific duties and a solid schedule.  My mornings would basically be arriving at 630 AM, wake the kids and feed them breakfast, get them ready, then drop them at school.  While the kids are at school, I would do laundry, dishes, daily light cleaning, etc.  After school is done I pick the kids up, spend the afternoon with them/take them to activities/appointments, and then prepare dinner for the whole family/clean up after, and hopefully leave by 630 PM.  While I have always felt like I was a tad bit underpaid for my work, it’s gotten a little out of hand lately.  Over the year, more and more has been sprinkled onto my plate without a pay increase.  I do meal planning now, grocery shopping for the whole week, put the parents laundry away for them, complete house (3 floors 😫) cleaning (wiping bathrooms and kitchen, vaccum, dust, mop, you get the point.), deep cleaning like fridges/stains, snow removal, and more.  Not to mention that over the weekends, they don’t touch the dishes/laundry/house so on Monday I’m doing a whole weekend of dishes, laundry and cleaning.  Also added onto this, the oldest daughter is now struggling a lot more with mental health issues.  I feel so terrible for her and will never understand how she feels completely, but she treats me terribly.  She lies to me about doing her 3 simple tasks everyday after school, talks bad about me to the other 3 kids (who love me thank god), screams at me if I tell her/ask her to do literally anything she doesn’t agree with.  I just don’t think she has an easy time with authority and her mom has kind of expressed that too.  The parents kind of bounce around that issue until it gets really bad and then they come up with a new temporary solution to try and get her to do her chores/listen to me.  I should also say my car gets TRASHED and it makes me really sad because it’s my first newer car that I bought all by myself.  Regardless, this job has just become a lot more demanding… I think?  Am I crazy? I don’t want to say I feel used but I do just feel mad when I think about it.  I should mention that we discussed a raise when adding grocery shopping and meal planning onto my plate, but it’s been 2 months if me doing it and nothing has happened.  Also the mom literally tells me i’m the backbone of their family and the only the reason she can pursue her career in the way she is.  I feel so shitty about even considering leaving.

Alright

So I have a friend who recently has been expressing interest and extreme care in fighting for LGBTQ+ rights. Of course, this is a wonderful thing, as we both are members of the community. However, they have been treating me and our friends like we are transphobic, homophobic, etc. because we are not doing the same. They claim that not taking action and constantly researching the bad things that happen to LGBTQ+ people like they do means we ""dont care"" about what our community goes through. 

We are both minors are cannot organize events to advocate for these rights and most of us (including myself) are in a household where we don't feel safe making our identity known and doing these things publicly. The friend also hasn't organized anything, despite expressing wanting to, and yet constantly tells us we aren't ""doing anything"" when there's not much we CAN do besides sign petitions (again, we are all minors).

I expressed these thoughts to them but they still said we were homophobic/transphobic.

this year, for his birthday, I got him a new tie and a watch and we had dinner at his favourite restaurant. He looked disappointed the entire time and at the end of the date, he asked me if that was it. I told him yes and asked if he didn’t like it he said he loved it and thanked me then left. 

He has been short with me lately and one of our mutual friends told me my bf was deeply disappointed and felt like I didn’t put enough thought and effort into it.

— co-signed a few things for my oldest kid and despite removing my name several years ago I can still see the accounts online because I opened them and they still exist. Kid never closed the accounts. 

Grow up. 
Move to another bank.",1,0,252,252,"My mom works at my bank and has for 10 years. She's the one who opened my account when I was 13. And she's always watched my spending from work and would tell me or make a comment about it whenever I spent more than she thought I should or didn't approve of what I bought. When I was younger I was ok with it. But when I went to college I asked if she'd respect my privacy. She didn't. She would still do the same thing and when I moved back home after graduation it still did. Finally after god knows how many fights with her and dad I got her off my debit card. But she could still see my credit cause she's the one who applied. I kept this card because i admit to having a spending problem sometimes. And this card has a limit so I don't over do it. It's handy.
I'm now 23 and I live on my own with my bf and pay my own bills and rent. Today she messaged me again saying she saw I spent money on an app game I have on my phone. Now I admit I spent more than I should have cause i was bored and wanted more opportunities to play on the game. I had already paid off the money I used but she didn't care about that. She said that I shouldn't be doing that and it was way to much. I got angry and snapped a bit that why was she looking at my account anyway. She said frivolous spending could effect her credit if I didn't pay. I asked her did I ever miss a payment? Did I have a bad credit score? Was I using her money?
 Answer to all no. My score is fine and I never miss a payment and I pay off my card when I get paid. I told her she was invading my privacy and I would hope she'd respect that and stop looking all this does is cause an argument whenever she does this and I don't like fighting we have a good relationship minus this . She then told me if it was such a big deal then cancel the card and get a new one without her. I said ya that's what I'm going to do because I'm tired of her snooping and lecturing me on spending MY money. She then said forget it and stopped texting me. I'm just waiting for later when dad calls to defend her like always. So AITA for yelling at her and telling her I'd cancel the account so she can't see it?

Edit: Ok guys so gonna clear up some things. 1. The card is in my name my mom did get it when I was 13 and in her name then, when I was 18 we put it in my name as the carrier. Because the way her bank works I guess despite me being the primary she can still see cause she opened it at least that's what she has told me. 
2. This is not the first time this has been argued. When I was in college this happened and we had a blow out she agreed to stop. But when I moved back home she resumed and this fight kept happening. I gave up on the argument for awhile cause I just didn't want to deal with it I just snapped this time. It was building for awhile. Yes 3.I understand if I had just switched banks this wouldn't have happened but i was worried about the fall out and if my mom would just not get over it and hold it over me forever and didn't want to lose our relationship over something like this.

I have also taken in everyone's opinions and thank you for them even if you think IATA. I understand this could have been avoided if I changed my bank but I'll admit I'm the optimist and was hoping she'd stop when I asked even though it was multiple times. My own fault and I am definitely changing my bank this week. Not excited about the fall out because I'm sure she'll guilt trip me when she finds out I move my funds but hopefully it will be 1 fight and when it ends this all just stops.

"AITAH for telling a lady to get off of a machine at the gym if she wasn’t going to use it?","Nta-",1,0,2255,2255,"There are two lat pull down set-ups at our gym and it is a VERY busy gym. 

I (33F) was working out on a machine behind the lat pull downs and saw this lady (prob in her early 40s, very fit) sitting on one of the machines, chatting away, not doing a single rep. The other lat pull down was occupied by two guys going pretty hard. 

A little background: This lady is a repeat offender-she loves to sit on a machine-not use it- and chat with people…once the conversation is done she’ll eventually start her workout (the number of times I’ve waited for her on the leg abductor and leg press while she chatted away not using the machine…I digress…back to the story).

I saw a timid girl (probably late teens early 20s) shyly/very politely ask the lady if she could work in-the lady said no, that she hadn’t used it yet. The girl walked away, looking embarrassed.

I got hot. 

I called out to the lady and said with very clear irritation “excuse me, ma’am, hey. It’s  very busy right now. I’ve watched you sit on this machine for at least the last 5 minutes chatting to your buddy without doing a single rep. If you’re not going to use it, it’s f*****d up to not let someone else in.” 

The lady told me I was rude but got up and let the other girl (who mouthed me a “thank you”) in. 

The lady also reported me to management for “being rude” (didn’t affect my membership, just a quick word from an employee) and now this lady proceeds to glare at me anytime she sees me in the gym. 

When I told my friend they said that the lady was obviously messed up, but it was not my place to say anything to her. Also that my condescending tone would have riled anyone up. 

AITA?

"AITA for shouting at my mother in secret for bringing up my father’s parents on my sister’s birthday?","First off, sorry that this happened to you and that you are having to deal with this. I think it's a tough situation because I'm sure both of them are dealing with trauma. Do I think your mom should've listened and not said anything if she knew your sister would get upset? Yes. But she also didn't mention the grandparents... she simply asked who the card was from and then ended the conversation. You are stuck in the middle of a difficult situation so I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.",4,0,1,1,"So my sister (29F), mother (65F) and I live together and every single birthday, something happens where my father’s parents bring a card over. And every single time my mother asks about it in a weird way - which causes my sister to go up to her room, upset that my mother said it weirdly, on her birthday. My mother does do it on MY birthday too but I don’t take any notice of it. 

My father abused my mother sometimes and cheated on her(?), but it’s a sore subject for my sister as he contacts her and she doesn’t like to talk about it. Growing up, my mother and father were constantly arguing. My sister always says that they’re the reason we’re so fucked up & that I shouldn’t have been put through that as I was a child when they started to fight. My mother was a very angry woman, and my father was always focused on work and sports. But tbh looking back on it he seemed depressed. Idk there’s a lot of things that happened and the proof of the big accusations nobody really has. Except for the abusing part - as my mum has some photos. Anyways, my father doesn’t contact me but his parents, who we’re not fussed on, always puts a birthday card through our door.

Well, it happened again as it’s my sisters birthday and I told my mother, who noticed the card through the door, to NOT say anything. She said she wouldn’t. 

I went upstairs and came back down to my mother asking my sister who the card (that she hid from my mother even though I told her that mum had already seen it) was off and if they gave her anything.

My sister bluntly said: “Grandparents, they gave me money” and huffed and went upstairs. I went into the living room and my mother was eating a sandwich, she looked at me with wide eyes and I whispered angrily “Why’d you go and bloody say that for after I told you not to?!” and she said that there was nothing wrong with asking.

I proceeded to go up to my room to collect myself, and then after I heard my sister go and into the shower, I went back downstairs and angrily questioned my mother. I said stuff like “you told me you wouldn’t do it”, “you’ve upset her on her birthday, this was supposed to be a nice day for her” and she’s gotten all shaky and replied to me with “I’m not a child.” and “I know I ruin every day!” And trying to make me feel bad. She always denies that’s she’s in the wrong. She knows that my sister gets upset whenever it’s brought up. 

Now I’m stuck in a house with an upset, stubborn mother, and an upset, fed up sister on her birthday. I’m stuck in the middle again and I feel sick. I feel bad for going off at my mother, but she shouldn’t have said anything to my sister about them when she said she wouldn’t. 

I keep getting involved in their arguments and it’s stressing me out. AITA?

I’ll also say though, if I AM the asshole, I’ll accept that and any advice y’all can give about the situation because I’m the youngest in the family and I’m not entirely sure how to deal with this without getting anxious.",1,"krubaisy","cherryandfizz",0

It's clear that Molly's behavior is causing you a great deal of distress, and you have every right to feel upset when she speaks ill of you and your family, yells, and takes your belongings without permission. Establishing boundaries is important, especially when it comes to your personal space and possessions.

That being said, I'm going to give you a verdict of NTA for wanting to protect your space and belongings. You've been accommodating in the past, and it's understandable that you've reached a breaking point.

However, before you resort to locking your door, I would recommend having an open and honest conversation with both Molly and your mom. Explain how Molly's actions have made you feel and express your concerns about her taking your belongings. Set clear expectations for her behavior during her visit, and let her know that you'll need to take measures to protect your belongings if she doesn't respect your boundaries.

By addressing the issue head-on, you may be able to resolve the situation without resorting to drastic measures, and possibly foster a better understanding between you and Molly. Good luck navigating these turbulent family waters!",9,0,545,545,"My sister (let’s call her Molly) lives away from my family for years now and only comes to visit once or twice a year.

She does this out of spite because she only takes things I ask her not to take with her while leaving behind things she asked for and I gave to her. She’s coming to visit again in 5 days and I already said to my mom I don’t want her to stay in my room anymore, and am considering locking my door everytime I’m out so she can’t come in and sneak my stuff in her bag (because this is exactly the type of person she’s shown to be now).

The reason my ex and I split up was while we were both not religious when we dated and both had Muslim ancestry, after we got married, he started believing again and wanted me and my daughter to do the same. We did for many years but then, eventually I realized I was just pretending and hated that life. I told him and filed for divorce and he got really angry. The custody was split and I had to pay child support as I made a lot more than him.

It has been 3 years and when my daughter lives with him, he makes her wear abaya and hijab, including at school and tries to convince her to believe. She says that he shouts at her if she ever questions it or expresses that she does not want to. I have always told my daughter that it is her choice and she can chose to believe or not but did tell her that I do not believe and think that these practices are sexist. My daughter chose to also stop believing and my ex blames me and said I brainwashed her, since she used to believe when we were together.

My daughter cries every time the last day she has to spend with me in the week arrives. She says she has to do their house work there.

I am thinking of seeing a lawyer to see if I can get full custody and stop the child support and thinking of asking my daughter to secretly record him with a small dictaphone when he gets angry.

I'm a lesbian who hasn't been mistaken for straight in yearrrrs tho - like I've been mistaken more often for a teenage boy than a straight woman TBH. 

Anyway, back to the birthday gift.. i knew my friend was building a home woodshop and wanted to learn metal working, and I had this old MIG welder I haven't used in years. 

I've been trying to be more sustainable in gift giving and go for secondhand or homemade instead of buying retail.

So i cleaned it up, and gifted it to him with a note saying I could teach him how to use it. I had honestly been insecure giving him a used gift - I was hoping it wouldn't come off like I was regifting old junk from my shop, but I figured it'd be fine since it was a more expensive tool (like $500 new) and all my friends know I've sworn off shopping new. 

But I was honestly surprised how it went - I went to my friends party and gave him the welder, and it was by far the gift he was the most excited about and he was saying how it was way too nice of a gift, I shouldn't have, and that on top of me teaching him to use it? 

I was like ""Omg it's fine - honestly it's not new, and I'm just happy someone would use it because I haven't been! And joked that if he really felt like he owed me, he could learn how to use it on this fence I've been meaning to fix or replace."" 

I started drinking with a bunch of my friends there and his girlfriend came up to me later saying ""she knew what I was doing getting him that gift"" 

I was fairly drunk and unserious and was like ""What, trying to bribe my way into getting my fence fixed?"" 

She got mad and said that it was super inappropriate to get a guy in a relationship a really expensive gift, it was hundreds of dollars and she couldn't afford that kinda gift. Plus one that meant he was gonna hang out with me one on one? 

I was like ""girl when have you ever met a straight girl who likes welding? Like not to stereotype but... Look at me, do you really think I'm into your man?"" 

She called me purposefully ignorant, and that it was just basic common sense to not get a guy friend a elaborate gift when he has a girlfriend. And not with a note asking to do something alone. 

I got mad and was like ""I didn't fucking say alone! You woulda been welcome if you asked literally any other way!"" 

She said she didn't want to hang out when we welded my fence, she wanted me to back off and that ""every girl knows"" these rules about what's appropriate around taken guys. And I was like ""I dunno, that sounds like some straight people shit, I ain't always thinking about gender like that"" Which was honestly kinda petty of me, but that really made her mad.

I live far away from my family so mainly communicate over a family group chat. I don’t get to see them very often as it’s expensive to fly, and they all have kids too so it makes travelling a bit tricky. 

So when I messaged my family introducing my son with his name - Oliver, the general response was positive- however my brother and his wife (both nearly 40) sent me a nasty text and wouldn’t speak to me. I didn’t understand why as it was a short message and didn’t explain anything- just that they were angry about his name. Since they wouldn’t speak to me I rang my sister. She explained that they had taken offence and that they thought the name was too similar to their daughter’s name - Olivia…. She explained they were very angry with us and not willing to speak to us at the moment. I was completely shocked and it’s all been very upsetting. 

I’ve spoken to my parents and my other sister who are also very confused by their reaction. My sister-in-law has said to them that they might be willing to allow us to use Oliver as a middle name but if we use it as a first name that that will essentially lead to an end of relationship between us and them. 

I don’t feel I have to justify or ask permission for naming my son and feel they are being controlling with double standards.

"AITA for going on a trip with a friend during a tough time for my wife?","I'd look at the bigger picture. I'm only married a year, we've been together 14 years. We've been through a helluva lot in that time.. the biggie being we relocated away from our friends&family then me diagnosed with ovarian cancer and unable to have kids not to mention the fact it was life threatening. He has been my rock. I've watched him juggle a laptop in busy hospital waiting rooms whilst trying to work on on his new job we relocated for..and he drove me miles/sat with me through numerous appointments, including chemo. The list goes on.  

We're no angels, we've had some whopping fights & could kill each other at times. But he's helped me through so much & does so much for me that with this ""first world problem"" as someone else said..I'd love it if my husband could go do something he loved for a few days with a mate. It's been a few years since he did. I recently lost my beautiful brother, I'm still devastated.

"AITA for leaving my friends party after they expected their guests to pay for drinks?","NTA. I wouldn’t have bought one drink.",1,0,6647,6647,"This past weekend my wife (41F) I (42M) attended one of my friends party's that I was invited to. For context my friend (42M) his gf (48F) and their two friends (also mid 40's M&F) were hosting this party the **4 of them together.**

A few weeks ago when I received the invitation I realized that it said on it something along the lines of ""please be prepared to purchase your own drinks"". Didn't think much of it at the time considering I just thought they were hiring a bar tender or something, but fast forward to the day of the party.

I arrive with my wife and it's my friend and his gf standing behind their kitchen counter that they were using as their ""bar"", making/charging the guests for drinks. Now I was confused for a few reasons...

1, the fact that this party was held at my friends house, it's not like this was at an event space or something where this would be normal imo. 2, there was no bar tender that they hired or anything like that. It was literally 2 of the 4 of them standing in the kitchen at a time making drinks for people and then charging them accordingly (drinks were all under $10).

Now idk if this is actually a common thing, but I have never in my 42 years of living been to a ""party"" at a friends house where the hosts are charging you themselves for drinks.

I've had multiple parties over the years, that I have invited my friend and his gf to in which they have attended, and I've never charged **ANYONE** for drinks ever. I've always bought all the drinks myself and had an open bar type of situation. Where my guests can make there own drinks. I even had a proper bar tender once and still no one was charged, it was an open bar.

I honestly felt like my friend, his gf and their friends were all trying to make a quick buck off of their guests who attended. Clearly to cover to cost of the drinks. Which yeah I understand that booze isn't cheap these days but we're talking splitting the cost of whatever they bought between **4 PEOPLE**. Like in my opinion if you can't afford to supply drinks at your party, why are you having a party in the first place?

This also wasn't for charity or anything the money made off of the drinks was for them to split.

My wife and I bought one drink each, stayed for about an hour or so, and said our goodbyes. When we were leaving my friend asked why we didn't have that much to drink? I told him because I think it's ridiculous that they are charging their close friends for drinks. He called me cheap and an unsupportive friend. I assured him that i'm not, if the charging of drinks was for a good cause (like profits go to charity or something) of course i'd buy drinks.

I told him I find the fact that they are charging for drinks, and keeping the money for themselves ridiculous and taking advantage of their friends. Anyway now my friend and his gf are butt hurt about this and have been calling me an AH to our mutual friends. AITA here?

(EDIT: Wow! I did not expect this post to blow up like this but thank you guys.

One day, while I was away, my grandfather let my dog out in the backyard for a few minutes. He didn’t notice that my neighbor’s dog was also there. Somehow, he managed to get close to my dog and mate with her without anyone noticing, this wouldn't usually happen as my dog would usually bark away other dogs and coincidentally according to my father, he saw my neighbor's outside just deliberately waiting for his dog to get a lock on my dog and did not stop his dog.

A few weeks ago, she gave birth to five beautiful puppies. They are all healthy and adorable. They look like a mix of both parents.

However, as soon as my neighbor found out about the puppies, he came over and demanded that I give him one of them. He said that since his dog was the father, he had the right to claim one of them as his own.

I refused to give him any of the puppies because:

A. He never asked me for permission or consent before letting his dog mate with mine.
B. He never took any responsibility or care for his dog or mine during or after the pregnancy.
C. He doesn’t have a proper environment or lifestyle for raising a puppy.
D. He feeds his dog human food which is bad for their health.

I don’t know what to do now. I don’t want to give up any of the puppies because:

A. They are part of my family now and I love them all equally.
B. They are bonded with their mother and siblings and separating them would be traumatic for them.
C. They are still too young to be weaned or separated from their mother (they are only 4 weeks old).
D. He leaves his dog outside all day without shelter or attention.

Am i the asshole for wanting to keep them?

Edit: I want to thank everyone for taking the time to comment and educate me for the effects of keeping them together, i might also have been probably the YTA for my own selfishness of keeping them for their ""own"" good, but learning upon the effects of keeping them together and as others pointed out, me being 15 and not being able to afford to neuter/spay them, i will be having them entrusted some* trusted relatives of mine believing they will have a good home once mama dog shows signs of not wanting to have anything with them anymore.",1391,"Loud-Action-1119","FranzMCPE",0

I was 8 at the time. She moved 3 hours away because she needed a support network.

Clearly she was wrong but I was a kid and adapted. My father started legal proceedings against my mother and the whole thing took 6 years.

I would visit my father for half of summer vacation and many holidays. But I really loved my life with my mom.

When I was 14, my father basically threatened to have my mother arrested if she didn't let him have custody of me.

So against my own wishes, I was forced to move back to my dad's home full time.

I hated it here and I essentially lived a separate life from my dad and his family.

When I was 16, my grandad died and had left his company to his two sons (my dad and uncle) and me. We all got a third ownership. 

My dad and uncle had more kids but my grandfather never updated the will. My family says it's because he got too old to remember. 

So here is where I think I'm the asshole. Since I was 16, I didn't know any better and my dad and uncle just ran the company themselves.

But when I turned 18, my dad and uncle talked to me about splitting the company 50/50 between them so they could split it fairly among all the grandkids instead.

I would get a cash payout of $300k for my share.

But I talked to a lawyer on my own and refused to agree. In addition, I asked for my share of the profits since the past two years and that I'd be part of the business going forward while I was going to college.

This has made life extremely difficult for my dad. My uncle is extremely resentful that only one grandchild gets a huge stake. And my dad is now paying me my share of the profits for the past two years out of his own pocket just to keep the peace.

They poked until they got a reaction out of you, so think they reaped what they sowed.",10,0,29168,29168,"Background: I'm (F23) one of only a few female students in a male-dominated course. Furthermore, I am at a highly prestigious university and I haven't really gotten along with the guys on my course. They are all very competitive and I just don't really enjoy their company - everything turns into a pissing contest, and they definitely take me less seriously because I'm a woman. I stopped interacting with them beyond the mere minimum and choose to hang out with other people. 

Anyway:

I did well in our recent exams (I topped two out of four exams we had so far). Our prof congratulated me during class (I wouldn't have advertised this myself). Ever since then, my interactions with a specific group of male classmates have gotten weird. They're now outright rude and challenge me aggressively in class discussions. We recently had some presentations and one of them chose to do theirs on, to put it simply, ""pretty privilege"" - they specifically pointed to two papers that suggested that pretty female students get overscored in assessments. The other guys in the group snickered and one even gave me a wink. Afterwards, I heard them in the hallway joking that ""they had experience with that themselves"".

I've been seeing a PhD student within our department for a month. He has literally nothing to do with our course. Well, we ran into one of my course mates A together. The next day in class his friend B asked me if ""my boyfriend"" helped me with exams. He said this intentionally loudly and in front of the professor, who heard this. I replied that I don't have a boyfriend (cause he's not my bf), but then B pointed out that he had run into me with the PhD student, making a point to say his name (the prof knows him). I just replied that we're only friends.

They didn't let up - I heard that they discussed this thing in two more classes, in earshot of the professors. Both times they suggested I got help for my exams ( I wasn't even seeing him then). I didn’t confront them, but this has been causing me so much anxiety - even without the exam accusations, I worked hard to get here and I don’t want to be known among the faculty for my dating life.

I raised this issue with my supervisor, without the intention of taking it any further, but I wanted her advice as a woman in academia. She convinced me to let her email their supervisors ""to remind them of proper conduct"" and described their treatment of an ""unnamed female student"". She didn't name me, but they figured it out. They confronted me after class and asked my why I would report their “silly joke“. Apparently, their supervisors are now very cold towards them and less interested in helping. It’s not a formal complaint - only their supervisors know - but one of them, C, said his supervisor writes the reports for his financial aid/scholarship and it was my fault if he lost out on that.

I now feel a bit embarrassed and this was compounded by a friend telling me I took it to far cause C shouldn't lose out on his scholarship. So, reddit - AITA?

For the past 7 years, I’ve been staying in an apartment my mother bought. She always told me that when she died, she wanted me to have it because she worked so hard to ensure  I always had somewhere to live. So when she died, she left me the apartment in the will. My brother has no issue with this, he makes more than enough of his own money and actually owns an apartment in the same building. 

However, my aunts (A and B) have an issue with this. A has had money issues for as long as I’ve known her and my mother was always helping her out with money when she was alive. B is financially stable, but in no position to help A. They both think that since I make enough money to be able to rent a place, I should let A stay in the apartment and rent my own because that’s what my mother would have wanted. 

I said no, stating that my mother wanted me to have a place of my own. I am currently saving all the money I would have used on rent and intend to buy my own house when I have enough saved. 

When I said no, they then suggested that I should share some of the money my mother left me with them. She had two life insurance policies, both of which went only to my brother and I. She also left us the house and her car. Basically, everything was split between my brother and I and no one else got anything. My aunts feel that this was wrong and that they, especially A, deserve some of the money. 

My brother blocked them all on platforms when they asked this of him and suggests I do the same, but I feel guilty about cutting off my family. 

But I also feel strongly that if my mother wanted them to get money, she would have left them something. But she didn’t. She chose to leave EVERYTHING to my brother and I. My aunts are saying that my mother did that because she assumed we would share. But I knew my mother. She would have told me if she wanted me to do that. All she said was that she wanted to die knowing that me and my brother would be able to support ourselves.

SIL is Sophie, she’s 26F and married to my husband’s brother. I’m 29F.

Sophie has been married to my BIL since late 2021. Whenever we have had holidays she has spent it with her family, and my husband and I only go back to his hometown during the holidays - so I don’t know her well.

Anyway we have a holiday coming up in just over a month. For the first time Sophie’s parents will be away so she will be celebrating with us.

That’s all background. As is the fact that my MIL is a trained patissier. I promise it’s relevant.

I happened to be in town this week and MIL started putting together her list of ingredients for the stuff she will make. She was consulting me, and my husband’s sister Zara, about what to make and also delegated a couple of things to each of us.

Sophie came into the living room and said “oh I can definitely make better brownies, tartlets and whatever else than [my name]!”

Now my MIL takes desserts very seriously. I said okay you can make that stuff but MIL said no we need to have the nicest sweets. There was a back and forth and Sophie suggested what I can only describe as a bake off.

So we made brownies, tiramisu, lemon meringue and the family judged between us and everyone voted in my favour. 

Sophie got mad at me and said I’d hidden the fact that I know how to bake from her to which Zara said neither of us really bake when MIL is around because she’s amazing but that we both *can* if we need to.

Now Sophie is mad at me for both hiding my ability from her and for purposefully embarrassing her in front of our in laws. I think she’s stupid - she wanted the silly bake off right up until she lost, it’s not my fault she has an ego

We have two sons together (8 & 6), I have a son from a previous relationship (15), and I have 3 step children (20F, 16M & 16F). We live in a 4 bedroom house and for most the time we lived there we had 2 kids per room with the youngest boys sharing, the older boys sharing and the girls sharing. 

Things changed a couple years ago. My oldest stepdaughter finished school and is attending university locally. The girls decided at this point that instead of sharing a bedroom at their dads and sharing a bedroom at their mums, they would each take 1 room as their permanent bedroom. So the 16 yr old lives with us full time and the 20 yr old lives with her mum full time. They both visit the other parents house regularly. 

My 16 yr old stepson has his own bedroom at his mum's house but still splits time between each parents house mostly 50/50. My son lives full time with us as he doesn't have much of a relationship with his dad. My son and stepson do not get on that well and they can often be heard screaming at each other in their bedroom. 

Recently, I asked my stepson why he doesn't move to live full time with his mum so he and my son can have a similar arrangement as their sisters. This way both of the boys would have their own rooms. He would obviously still visit like his older sister does and we could figure something out like a futon instead of a bed in their room so my son has more space when stepson's not there. 

My stepson overreacted to my suggestion and is trying to make out like I'm kicking him out, when really I'm just thinking of a better use of space.

My in-laws decided they were old school cool and I was shining them on. They each took a full piece. That was Friday night. 

They didn't move from the couch until Saturday afternoon.  

They had plans that went sideways. I'm not sure how that's my fault. They literally took four times as much as I recommended. 

My wife is upset with me and so are my in-laws. They ended up staying until Sunday when they felt normal. I tried to explain that the cannabis I grow is stronger than whatever they are used to from the 90s but I'm still in trouble.",4852,"AluminiumCucumbers","AdTrue2705",1

"AITA for using baby skincare products?","NTA Her per planning isn't your problem. Everybody can buys the products. You are not the only one to use baby products for sensity skin or hair. And the problem is more people who hog all the products as thise who have no babys and buy it.

And who even ask strangers WHY they buy product xy?! That is not of your concern, lady! What was her gameplan if OP says ""yes"" to having a baby? Butching about the restocking police of the store? Or when OP is still younger, why she has a child in this age? Or make a new mommy friend? I don't get the question. Do i ask someone in the tampon aisle ""Oh, are you also on your period?"" Great way to make friends, try it! ",1,0,21,21,"I have very sensitive skin and frequently find that products intended for babies work better for me than the ones targeted to adults.
So I was at the grocery store the other day. On the way there I ran through a tree but that’s a story for another day.
So I was at the grocery store right, and I was restocking my skincare products with 2 bottles of baby wash and 2 tubs of baby cream. This lady behind me asks me if I have a baby. I was raised well so I was honest and said no these are for me. She then proceeded to scold me saying those products are for babies only and me using them makes parents miss out on products they use for their babies. She told me how last week she was out of baby wash and rushed to the store only to find the baby products out of stock. 
I said no sorry but she got upset and told me I didn’t understand. 
I ran away because I was annoyed and paid and drove off. Don’t worry I drive carefully tho.

"AITA for getting upset when my boyfriend talks badly about my family?","NTA.

""He's amazing at everything else"", except for the parts where he insisted your family sucks despite you improving your relationship with them (even though family is important) and your self-started successful business which he wants you to abandon because it isn't that important.

Yeah, sounds like a real prize. ",3,0,2,2,"Backstory: My (25F) boyfriend (26M) currently have a long distance relationship. We met back in high-school and started dating about 6months ago. He lost his job a month ago and I have a business that I can't move. We have been discussing who will be the one to move and yesterday after weighing all options put my foot down and said that I can't be the one that moves because of my business. There isn't nearly as much for me to do with my business where he lives compared to where I live. It doesn't make sense to move and he can do his same job anywhere. 

Now to the family part. He and his family have always been close whereas my family wasn't always the best and we had a falling out for about a year and just regained contact about 9months ago and things are going good so far and I'm happy. My boyfriend however keeps saying that his family is better than mine and gets upset when I defend my family because he feels they don't deserve it. He said he worries about our future children being around them (I'm not even pregnant) and said they don't compare to his family. He has only met my patents once for a few hours and they were nothing but kind to him. I express to him that what he is saying is hurting me but he feels it needs to be discussed because one of us has to move and family is a factor and he's just being logical and then just keeps repeating everything that upset me right after I told him it upset me. I understand needing to talk about it but I feel there is a better way to talk about a sensitive topic than the harsh and abrasive way he is. 

He also devalued my business that I'm super successful in and wants me to just throw away 3.5years of hard work and attempt to rebuild it where he lives if I even can or just get another job because ""my job is not that difficult and I don't even need a degree for it and it's just a job."" My job isn't just a job to me. I feel he should be more supportive of me and my decision to reconnect with my family rather than constantly bringing it down when he wasn't even there for the bad parts. And I feel he should be proud of me for the business I built and how successful I am. He also called me selfish and closed minded for saying I won't leave my business.
