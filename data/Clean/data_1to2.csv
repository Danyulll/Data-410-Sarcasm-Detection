A friend of mine asked me if he could use my login to watch it rather than pay for it himself. I said sure and sent him my username and password - but under the condition that I get to kick him out if he's watching it and I want to (I only have single screen access). He said that was fine.

This morning I went to watch the last episode and I got a message that I'm already watching somewhere else, so I message him asking him to quit so I can watch. (I know, sort of a dick move, but we did agree those terms, and also I only had an hour free this morning before work). He replies that it's not him, but that he'll ask ""Samantha"" to sign out. Samantha is a friend of his.

I ask why Samatha has my login and he said he shared it with her. I asked why the hell he thought that was appropriate, and he said it's no big deal, she just wanted to watch the show too, she's a friend of his and I've met her and ""like her"", so I shouldn't care either. I told him that was a ridiculous thing to say, and he had no right to do that. 

I immediately signed into my account, kicked them both out and changed the password.

He's pissed at me, thinks I'm overreacting and won't apologise/ admit he was wrong. I think it was not an okay thing to do.

"AITA for not inviting/paying for my brothers GFs son to go to Disney?","NTA

The entitlement is truly shocking.

I (28f) and husband (30M) do not have kids. We both have decent paying jobs and a real estate. That said we love to travel and many times also pay & invite our families to go with us.
My brother (26M) married and had my nephew (4m) with my middle school best friend (28F). Yes, he married my best friend and we are still best friends. They had my nephew and years later divorced.

To the Point: My brother started dating his new GF we will call her Ashley. They’ve been together for around 9 ish months. They’re not engaged or married. She has a son who is 5, we will call him John. I’ve only met John a handful of times. He’s a nice kid but I don’t really know him. I only know Ashley on an first name basis in a way. We talk occasionally but nothing in depth.

I invited my ex SIL& nephew to Disney this summer for 6 days. 2 days in Disney, 1 in Universal. The remaining days would be chill/Orlando days.
We are paying for them to go. I’ve always wanted to take nephew to Disney since he was smaller. He loves Mickey! We didn’t tell him in front of John or Ashley. 
But it made it back to Ashley that we are taking him. She confronts me at a family dinner on the side& tells me she’s upset we are not including her child and that he should have been invited. She said he doesn’t feel like he fits in/ is family and that is excluding him from Disney has made him cry all night. I was so shocked.

We are easily paying $2k for my nephew & best friend to go. Tickets, airfare, lodging, and of course some toys. 

I blew up. I told her that I didn’t even know her or her kid. They have only been around for a few months & he’s not my nephew. I told her I didn’t like the entitled mentality and to make it a point I would make sure to exclude her from all future family gatherings. She left crying. My brother and parents are all upset with me. That I’m excluding this child& isolated them. I told them if they’d like to pay for them I don’t mind them tagging along but they all said “You have more means than us”. They’re not doing great financially which is why I didn’t ask in the beginning. She made a huge FB post and everyone is siding with her. 

Did I go too far? Should I have offered to include them? AITA?

Sadie got pregnant at 18 with Tyler, her boyfriend at that time. Tyler and his sister ended up in a car accident a few months after she announced she was pregnant. He and his sister didn't end up surviving the accident. Sadie was very upset during the rest of her pregnancy. My parents were luckily there to help her out.

After her babies were born, my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer because of all his smoking. My mom had to help my dad out a lot and didn't have as much time to help Sadie with her twins. Sadie reached out to me a few months ago and asked if we could send her some money every month so she could hire a babysitter for her kids and help my dad. Lewis and I agreed since we were financially stable and could afford it.

She was very thankful to us, but a few weeks ago, she reached out again and asked if we could move back to Canada to help with the twins. This time, Lewis and I refused. I feel like it's too much, we've built a life here in England and my husband has a demanding job here and it would take him a while to find another one in Canada.

"AITA for being cold towards my birthday guests at a party that I explicitly said I don’t want?","NTA but you are enabling your mom by allowing her to move in with you. You have to give her a deadline to move out and not cave",3,0,224,224,"My mother (55F) and I (24F) have been living together all my life. When I was an adolescent she moved halfway across the globe to give me a better chance at life so I have always felt indebted to her. However, she is incredibly controlling and at times even selfish. 

She has never wanted me to have a boyfriend (shamed my the boyfriend that I introduced to her for not being wealthy and asked me to break up with him for it, even though we aren’t either). She is also judgmental about the way I look, and about how much I spend on clothes (which is admittedly a lot but it is something that makes me happy, and I do it with my own money). 

A year ago, I got a job across the country that paid really well, and was able to move out. After 2 months of separate housing, she threw a massive fit, and said I am soulless and unloving for wanting to continue living on my own. That she feels unsafe alone. This is after we bought a house in our original city together that I agreed to continue paying the hoa fees for even after moving out. I gave in and had her move in with me. 

Now I am in a situation where I pay for the housing and bills and everything and she lives with me and doesn’t work. She however cooks and takes care of the house which I’m very grateful for. I would be totally fine with all this if she was willing to compromise with me even the slightest bit. 

I recently had a birthday, and she wanted me to plan something for it. So I set up a dinner out which we had with a few of our friends. It was a beautiful night; I had the best time. During planning this, we found out that one of our friends would be unable to make it to the dinner, so I was going to do something with her separately, and I had begged my mom to not invite people over to our house. I work long hours and we have a puppy. When we have people over, my mother hates that the puppy gets excited so she puts him on a leash and has me hold him the whole time. This makes it difficult for me and him both. 

I came home tonight at 8 pm to the news that we were going to have a birthday dinner in our house within 30 minutes. There were only 2 guests, but I was already exhausted and now roped into something that I explicitly asked to not happen. 

Low and behold, I was miserable the whole time. I was constantly on hold-the-dog duty while being tired and dealing with cramps. I just wanted these people to leave and there they were talking about manicures and Spain. By the time that they left (after 11 pm) I had been secretly glaring daggers at them and my mom for hours. I tried to act nice, didn’t say a rude thing, but was also not very into the conversation, and when they said they should leave, I didn’t contradict them. My mother thinks I am the asshole for not being happy that she cooked and planned a second birthday dinner for me.

Clearly she was wrong but I was a kid and adapted. My father started legal proceedings against my mother and the whole thing took 6 years.

I would visit my father for half of summer vacation and many holidays. But I really loved my life with my mom.

When I was 14, my father basically threatened to have my mother arrested if she didn't let him have custody of me.

So against my own wishes, I was forced to move back to my dad's home full time.

I hated it here and I essentially lived a separate life from my dad and his family.

When I was 16, my grandad died and had left his company to his two sons (my dad and uncle) and me. We all got a third ownership. 

My dad and uncle had more kids but my grandfather never updated the will. My family says it's because he got too old to remember. 

So here is where I think I'm the asshole. Since I was 16, I didn't know any better and my dad and uncle just ran the company themselves.

But when I turned 18, my dad and uncle talked to me about splitting the company 50/50 between them so they could split it fairly among all the grandkids instead.

I would get a cash payout of $300k for my share.

But I talked to a lawyer on my own and refused to agree. In addition, I asked for my share of the profits since the past two years and that I'd be part of the business going forward while I was going to college.

This has made life extremely difficult for my dad. My uncle is extremely resentful that only one grandchild gets a huge stake. And my dad is now paying me my share of the profits for the past two years out of his own pocket just to keep the peace.

I need to keep the car space because if I don’t, I will lose it. I cannot foresee me being able to survive in a job I love if I can’t drive.

I was uncomfortable with this as she has made my sister take out loans to pay for their Disney vacation and use her aid to buy her new sewing machine to which my dad had to pay her back both times.

To put it simply, Lia's jealous. She thinks I don't deserve to be there and get everything handed to me. I'm a hard worker and got a promotion recently, which set her off even more. 

Both of us had actually been applying to some other jobs as well, she got one of them so she's going to move out of state soon. I also got an offer but decided to stay here because of the promotion.

We had a family potluck over the weekend, and of course a lot of them had heard of my promotion and were congratulating me. Lia was there and she seemed fine throughout the night, but at one point my aunt (her stepmom) said something about how proud everyone is of me for being so successful in a traditionally man's field. 

I just said thanks and told her I'd gotten an offer from another place too, but decided to stay and I'm happy I have options on what I want to do. Lia overheard this and came at me, saying ""it's not about my options but my nepo privilege"" and how ""she got a new job too but everyone's kissing up to my ass"". 

I had enough at that point and told her to stop acting like a jealous bitch, and focus on herself instead of looking at what others have that she doesn't. 

She got upset and pretty much stormed off. I did text her later but she didn't reply.

I told my friend this (she knows Lia too) and she said I should apologize to Lia and what I said was way wrong. I don't really think so, but AITA? (My friend suggested to post here)",6314,"United-Loss4914","throwaway6794241",0

It sounds like you've respected her feelings and choices. I notice your son was comfortable being adopted by your husband. I also notice that hubby had no problem with your son accepting him as dad and his daughter not accepting you as mom.

If he can understand that and can accept that his daughter feels so strongly that you and his other children are not her family that she actively avoided using any photos that included you or them; then he needs to explain to you how he can accept and understand all that and not understand how HIS children might not want to go to a place where they were actively erased from existence.

His parents should also understand that as well, but it is YOUR HUSBAND's job to get it and to explain it to his parents.

I'm sorry she doesn't see any of you as family; I know that hurts. But you and the kids are very wise not to push yourselves on her. That is one of the most common recipes for family dysfunction among blended families.",2,0,2874,2874,"My husband and I have three biological children together, he adopted my child from a prior relationship and I am a stepmother to his adult child. My husband was divorced from my stepdaughter's mom. She was 8 when my husband and I became serious and my son was still a baby. Not long after my stepdaughter's mom died. My husband and I had talked about marrying before she died and we delayed it for a couple of years to allow my stepdaughter time to grieve and adjust to the changes in her life. This was with the help of therapy, of course. We knew a child who lost someone so close would need extra help.

Now my stepdaughter is 20, my son is 12 and our children together are 7, 6 and 4.

So what happened here is my stepdaughter and her boyfriend recently moved into a house together. She asked for help setting up their dining room and we all went over to help her. Her house was covered in photos. The landing had them, living room, kitchen, etc. There was not a single photo of her siblings in the house, or me, but it was not seeing one of the kids that led to this. She had her parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, her cousins, and friends. But there was no sign of the kids anywhere. All of the photos with her dad were older ones, from before we met. My 12 year old, 7 and 6 year old's noticed because they were excited to look around her house. I couldn't help but notice because her boyfriend had so many of his siblings and because there were some, what felt like deliberate choices, to make sure she used photos that didn't contain her siblings. Including extended family photos from years ago with my husband's side that were taken before her dad and I met. And we know she has photos with her siblings.

I always knew she wasn't super crazy about her siblings. I always hoped as she got older she would feel love for them. But it feels like she doesn't think of them as family or as special enough to be included. The three kids who noticed were hurt. My husband tried to assure them it was likely an oversight on her part and he called her the next day to ask. She said she had only wanted photos with people she considered family and she didn't consider us family.

We were all invited to her housewarming party. But the kids did not want to go. My husband and ILs were shocked and said they had to go of course. I argued that they didn't and I told him I would stay home with them. They argued back to me that the kids needed to be. I said they did not need to be there and I wouldn't force them to go when they already feel hurt. My husband and ILs think I'm unreasonable.

Update: from what everyone has said I am clearly NTA. Thank you all for your concern and well wishes. Ana and her family have been blocked and I will no longer be in contact with her. 

It was also brought up to me by another user that their was a similar post posted a few weeks ago from a hosts perspective. This is NOT the same post. My situation happened really recently (allot more recent than whatever the previous post was) I’m shocked to hear this has happened befor, but yeah it’s 💯 not related to ours haha


Finally I’ve had a few comments about my dog being “certified” that I want to clarify. I am not from the US so I’m unsure what your guys process is like, but all I mean is that Bailey has gone through the required testing, training and registration to ensure she is legally aloud to be classified as a service animal :) 


I just want to start by saying I’m pretty sure I’m not the A-hole. But my friend and her family are pretty certain that I am. Please bear with me, I’m just wanting some clarity over this situation to make sure I’m not crazy.

I (24 f) have epilepsy. I have a service dog (fully certified) who is trained to help me with my seizures. I have been diagnosed since a child, and I have had my current dog Bailey for 4 years now and she is the bestest girl around. (Before Bailey I had a previous service dog who we had to retire due to age… but having a service animal is by no means new for me). With her being a service dog she is obviously always with me. 

I have a core friend group who hangs out quite often. My one friend; let’s call her Anna) (also 24f) always makes really weird and almost passive aggressive comments about me and Bailey? Ex; dogs shouldn’t come to restaurants, I’m inconveniencing people, etc. she doesn’t get that I legitimately need her for my own safety. It’s not just for show.

My seizures are really regular; for context I actually get two different kinds. My “small ones” are petit Mal seizures. This essentially just looks like I’m zoning out and staring into space. Quite often people who don’t know me wouldn’t even connect this. My “big ones” are my main concern; these are focal seizures where I fully lose consciousness. This can happen a couple times a day for me so it’s obviously really important that I manage it to the best of my abilities. 

Anyways. Our friend Anna wanted to host a games night/appy night type thing at her house. When we there she lost it on me. She told me it was increadibly disrespectful that I showed up with Bailey without asking for permission first. That I can’t just assume people will be happy with a dog always being around. That I should have just stayed home if I couldn’t handle being out for a few hours without Bailey. I tried apologizing and pointing out that I assumed she knew I was bringing her since I’ve never gone anywhere without her. That set her off more. The guys were finally able to calm her down but her “compromise” was I had to put Bailey in the backyard.

I was an idiot and said fine because I didn’t want to inconvenience anyone more or continue stirring the pot. Bailey went out side and I returned inside with my friends. 

I ended up having a seizure, blacking out and smashing my head on the floor. I had to go to the hospital because of how hard I hit my head. 

I guess my friend group absolutely handed Ana her ass calling her hateful, toxic, and a jealous witch. I guess she was trying to say that I passed out for the attention and I got my way like always. Long story short no one wants her around anymore.

Since this happened her, her sister and mom have been blowing up my phone, calling me the ass hole and demanding I fix this situation and it’s honestly getting to me.. so Reddit. AITA?",9500,"F-nDiabolical","throwaway9876402",0

Nigel was a widower of three years when he met my sister. His kids at the time of them meeting were 6f and 8m. Nigel's late wife's family was around a lot. My sister hated it. From the very early days it was clear she was toxically jealous of Nigel's late wife and the kids mom. She talked about how strange it was the kids, who didn't remember her, had her photo in their bedrooms, how her stepdaughter had a locket with a photo of her mom, dad and brother in it. I remember back then asking how it was strange. Her mom was loved and Nigel and his late wife's family likely didn't want the kids to not know they were loved by their mom. She said that was her job now. I told her it wasn't healthy to feel that jealous and put out over a mom being remembered. Think of how she would feel if our mom died.

Honestly, I had a lot of respect for Nigel for the first two or three years because his kids seemed to be his priority and he seemed to still love and care about his late wife and not want to erase her but was also ready to be married to someone else. I had seen a lot of far more awful scenarios. But then he started letting my sister push herself onto the kids and try to force out their maternal relatives. It was very clear my sister blamed the maternal relatives for neither of her stepkids coming to think of her as their mom. She didn't want to hear any other reason it could be.

Now both of her stepkids are adults and her stepson became a father for the first time in January. His daughter is named after both her grandmother's. But his mom's name is her first name. My sister was so unhappy about that. She told him it was disrespectful to her and all that crap. He told her to go fuck herself and told her she still hadn't figured out that she wasn't his mom, she wasn't his parent, she wasn't even his real family, because he would happily dump her out of his life for good and would never feel bad about that.

My sister bitched for weeks about it and then I told her if I was her stepkid, I'd do the same. That she had no respect for his mom and had no respect for his maternal family. She freaked out and told me that was a shitty thing to say and I should be on HER side, because she's my SISTER.

"AITA For telling my MIL not to meddle with my and my fiancé's sex life?","NTA. These comments are going to sound very cynical, but this sounds like the prequel to all the overbearing MIL and young divorce stories on here.",1,0,1135,1135,"Me (19F) and my soon-to-be husband (21M) got engaged after 4 years together.

I was really young when we first started dating and the nagging of my MIL, wanting us to have kids early, always bothered me. I took my complaints to my fiancé but he dismissed me saying that i should ""understand his mother's ways"". I didn't get her hopes up about me having kids, because i always said that i wanted to mature enough to be able to raise a kid.

As i said, i just dismissed her nagging, until last week.

My fiancé came home from work (that btw he works with his mother), saying: ""I was with mom all that in the office,and after she told me some things i came to the conclusion that you should stop taking your birth control pills"". Unbelievable. Didn't even want to argue about something this ridiculous.

Time passed and we didn't touch this issue anymore.

The weekend came, and we went to visit my MIL's house, she took me to her room saying she needed to have a word with me and my fiancé.

She sat down on the bed and said: ""I had a discussion with Luiz (my fiancé's name), and i told him about my concern with you guys not having children at the appropriate age. Who knows if you're going to be able to have children with this disease of yours? As for now, he will no longer allow you to buy the birth control pills per my request""

(He never buyed them for me, i work 9 hours a day and everything i buy for myself comes from my money)

About ""my disease"": It's a disease that all the women in my father's side had: Uterus Cancer. My great-great-grandmother passed due to it, my great-grandmother too and my grandma had it after giving birth to my father, but the doctors took the uterus out before the cancer could spread further. My grandma was always cautious with me. Never had any issues, and i go to the gynecologist 2 times a year to do exams.

 I got enraged, and looked at my fiancé who was sitting beside her, and he just averted his eyes.

""you will regret leaving the thoughts of having kids after your graduation, because god time is now and i got a revelation from the pastor that one of my family members is going to try to have kids and it's not gonna be able to. I'm sure that person is you, and i'm worried for my son. I can't leave this marriage be if your thoughts don't align.""

When she said that last line, i exploded, saying ""Are you so desperate for me to sit on your son's cock and have a baby so what? It's not your business if we're having kids or not or if we're having sex or not, this must be a joke"".

The argument escalated but i don't remember much because i got so enraged that i started trembling and had to go home to calm myself down alone, as i left my fiancé there.

When he came home, he was pissed off saying that i disrespected his mother and that if i didn't apologise he would consider breaking off the engagement. Honestly am not making any effort to set things straight as i'm very offended by everything she said.

Valerie has an 8 year old daughter who Tom adopted last year. Valerie and Tom are expecting another baby together. Their daughter had suggestions for names for her baby brother or sister. Namely names that were nature themed (Wren, Dove, Lark, River, Hawthorn, Forrest, Cove, Ocean). My name is actually among one she suggested. My own brother has a bird name along with me lol. Tom proceeded to tell his daughter that those were not real names and that I had always disliked/hated my name and they didn't want their little baby to be the same. He said this in front of me and my husband. My husband thought he was crazy and told him I had never said that. Tom glared at my husband. Then his daughter asked me if I hated my name and I said I didn't. Valerie said it didn't really matter what I thought, but they didn't want their kid to have a weird name and she told their daughter they wanted baby to have a lovely name like she has. Their daughter said she liked my name better and didn't think her name was nice. My husband and Tom's parents were like, let's not insult other people's names when Tom and Valerie started to protest and reminded them that they were in the presence of someone with one of the so called ""ridiculous names"".

Fast forward on a couple of hours and Tom came over and told me I needed to tell his daughter that names like mine do not work on people and that I want her to stop wanting a sibling called that and start embracing her name and the name they will give her future sibling. He told me just because I wanted to live like a freak with a weird ass name didn't mean he wanted that for his kids.

I told him he was a lying asshole for putting words in my mouth and expecting me to do the same. I told him nobody said he needed to like my name, but to insult it, to insult me and then ask me to lie with him was unbelievable. I told him I didn't need to lie for him and wouldn't and to get out of my fucking face.

My husband and I left almost immediately after, apologizing for leaving abruptly to my ILs and to our niece. Tom called my husband after and said his daughter could have heard and I was an asshole for saying what I did to him when she was in the house.

"AITA Monthly Open Forum March 2023: Rule 11","Are baby name posts where the conflict is between the parents Rule 11 violations? The conflict when the parents disagree is different than a disagreement about baby name between a parent and non-parent soley because of the relationship between the parents.

I was inspired to write this since when I wrote this comment the top post of the sub has the OP saying they might divorce their wife if the wife goes with a name. Which if I understand this post is a clear violation of Rule 11.",7,0,238,238,"#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.


This month, we’re diving into all things rule 11. It’s one of our broadest rules, and often one of the most misunderstood.

Let’s start with the most common question - isn’t every post on this sub about some type of relationship? Yes, of course. One of the basic requirements of this sub is to post about interpersonal conflicts. And those typically don’t exist without some type of relationship (barring the random encounter with a stranger on the street, etc.).

What we look at is the nature of the relationship. When reviewing a post for rule 11, we ask ourselves if the conflict could exist outside the confines of a romantic relationship. Can this conflict exist between two friends, roommates, family members? If the answer is no, then it’s a rule 11 violation. A post about buying an engagement ring, considering a divorce/break-up, “catching feelings” for someone, romantic jealousy, dating, engaging in sexual acts, etc. are part of this rule. Choosing to not do any of the aforementioned also qualifies. 

u/CutlassKitty gave a fantastic example in Januray’s Open Forum that sums this part of the rule up nicely:
 > So ""AITA for telling my boyfriend to clean up after himself"" is allowed because it isn't about the relationship itself. But ""AITA for wanting affection from my partner"" isnt.

Borrowing from another user’s examples, u/stannenb gave this, also in January’s Open Forum:
> I think pineapple on pizza is an abomination. I've told my spouse if they have to indulge in something demonic like that, do it outside the home. AITA?
> I think pineapple on pizza is an abomination. I've told my spouse that if they indulge in something demonic like that, I'm going to leave them. AITA? 
> The first conflict, about pineapple pizza within a relationship, is fine.
> The second conflict is about ending the relationship because of pineapple pizza and would be removed.

However, rule 11 does not solely cover romantic relationships. It also covers cutting contact with/ghosting others. That includes family members and friends. Disclosing details of cheating also is covered and is often a reason for a post removal. 

Reproductive autonomy decisions, such as having a child (or not), keeping the pregnancy (or not), and adoption also fall under rule 11. We have included situations about who to allow in a delivery room under this umbrella, as these conflicts regularly lead to breakups/divorce or involve threats for the same.


You might be asking “Why aren’t these topics allowed here?” There’s a couple answers to that question. One is that 99% of these questions are essentially about consent. We all recognize that anyone has the right to revoke consent at any time, whether that’s in direct relation to sex or just in terms of staying in contact with someone, or anything in between. This isn’t a matter that we can give moral judgement on; we simply cannot condone allowing a post where people tell someone they were wrong to exercise their right to consent. Another answer is that Reddit is a big place, and there are a ton of subs dedicated to relationships, etc. The answer there is simple - we have no interest in being another relationship sub. r/findareddit is a great resource if you’re not sure which sub is a good fit for your post.

Listen to your brother and sorry for your loss ❤️‍🩹",1,0,2624,2624,"I (25F) recently lost my mother to cancer. Me and my brother (35M) are her only children. For the past 7 years, I’ve been staying in an apartment my mother bought. She always told me that when she died, she wanted me to have it because she worked so hard to ensure  I always had somewhere to live. So when she died, she left me the apartment in the will. My brother has no issue with this, he makes more than enough of his own money and actually owns an apartment in the same building. 

However, my aunts (A and B) have an issue with this. A has had money issues for as long as I’ve known her and my mother was always helping her out with money when she was alive. B is financially stable, but in no position to help A. They both think that since I make enough money to be able to rent a place, I should let A stay in the apartment and rent my own because that’s what my mother would have wanted. 

I said no, stating that my mother wanted me to have a place of my own. I am currently saving all the money I would have used on rent and intend to buy my own house when I have enough saved. 

When I said no, they then suggested that I should share some of the money my mother left me with them. She had two life insurance policies, both of which went only to my brother and I. She also left us the house and her car. Basically, everything was split between my brother and I and no one else got anything. My aunts feel that this was wrong and that they, especially A, deserve some of the money. 

My brother blocked them all on platforms when they asked this of him and suggests I do the same, but I feel guilty about cutting off my family. 

But I also feel strongly that if my mother wanted them to get money, she would have left them something. But she didn’t. She chose to leave EVERYTHING to my brother and I. My aunts are saying that my mother did that because she assumed we would share. But I knew my mother. She would have told me if she wanted me to do that. All she said was that she wanted to die knowing that me and my brother would be able to support ourselves. 

So, AITA for not giving money to A or allowing A to stay in my apartment?",2624,"whitekimpony","Ok_Oil_324",0

I (36m) used to run a company with my (35m) brother and both my parents. It was supposed to be the dream of the sons taking over the family business. I had the ability to work in every department, so over the course of the last 10 years I progressed to running the company. My brother, who worked harder than anyone else, floundered with any real responsibility. He was the ultimate task doer, but ask him to manage anyone or anything, and it would be a dumpster fire.

My parents would protect my brother by tying my hands behind my back in regards to saying anything bad to my brother about the quality of his work, or how he was failing at being a manager. My parents did not want his feelings to be hurt. My brother would get moved to a different department, or have his job description change so he wasn't in charge of anything that would hurt the company. They would never tell him he wasn't doing his job right, they would never tell him he sucked at his job. It was easier for  them to lie to him, so they could avoid any conflict or hurt feelings.

I was complicit in this. I kept up the lies, I played the game. Resentments grew. My brother was still getting paid the same as me, I was running the company, at this point he was basically still in a entry level position. So 2 years ago I started a different company and left the family one. Less than a year later, my parents asked me to come back. I accepted on the condition that my brother would be bought out of the company. They agreed.

So with my brother being bought out, I am now running the company solo, we gave him a group of our customers that he now services under his own company name, life is good, or so I though.....

I found out by one of my employees, that my brother has been stealing product out of our warehouse. They were under the impression that we had some sort of deal worked out with me because we were family. NOPE..... He was just plain stealing.

So when I confront my brother, he admits to stealing, but went off on this rant on how I never respected him, that I was the biggest asshole because I was mean, and on and on. So then and there I decided to stop lying, and essentially told him all of the lies from the last 10 years. How he got the short end of the stick because no one ever told him what he was doing wrong. How our parents just didn't want to hurt his feelings, but knew he couldn't run the company. I was done lying, I just sat there and told the truth.

So my parents are now mad at me because he's mad. Like MAD MAD, and he has gone no contact with them, and they are worried that they wont be able to ever see him or their grandchildren again.

So AITA for finally telling my brother the truth, but throwing my parents under the bus to do so?

EDIT: To add to more information to this story, it was not like my brother was thrown into a situation without training. We provided informal training on how to learn more about the business (Like this is how we do the books, come with me on the jobsite so I can show you this). Formal training both trade specific and management courses. He was not thrown to the wolves, he just never cared to pick it up, or try to step up. 

I left the company because of the toxic environment and all of the built up resentments.

I came back to the company because my parents retirements are tied to the company and without a son to run it or a sale, they would have lost everything. I still run the other company I started.

Last, I knew I was an asshole for what I did to my brother. When I told him the truth, I was also apologizing to him for my part in all of it. I was asking if I was the asshole for throwing my parents under the bus in the truth/apology.",2110,"Wild_Butterscotch977","poolmoney1",0

Lily is a bully. I have met her a handful of times and she is always making fun of Eni, who is a little fat, Lily's always telling that bad pig jokes and she even gave Eni a nickname, Pigni.
I have complained to Tom and Tom's mom that Lily's jokes weren't funny and she should stop, but they always said she was just joking. I told Eni that she should return the jokes to Lily, but she can never think of anything to say.
Last year I was invited to Tom's family's Christmas party, everything was fine until Lily said something like ""Oh God Eni, you've already eaten so much, at this pace you'll stop being Pigni to become Whalni"" and she laugh with the children at the party. I was furious and Eni and Tom gave a fake laugh and said that Eni was 4 months pregnant. When we were all congratulating them, Lily said ""wow, at least now you can excuse yourself when people see you eating like a pig."" I got furious again but Eni asked me to just let it go but I know how much that jokes hurt her. So I went back to having a talk with Tom and his mother about why Lily's teasing had to stop.
 Well, this weekend was Eni's babyshower, we were having a good time until Lily told another joke about how ""fat"" Eni had gotten, I had enough so I laughed so loud to attract attention and said ""Oh Lily, you're so funny, especially when you finish your jokes with that ugly pig laugh, sometimes I think people laugh more at your laugh than at your joke."" Lily got super serious and she told me it wasn't funny, to which I said ""come on, it's a joke"" and imitated her laugh, the kids at the party laughed too and Lily ran away while she cried. Tom's mother scolded me for the joke and I asked her why Lily's jokes were funny but mine weren't, if they both had a pig joke in it, and her mother couldn't answer me. I told her that every time I heard Lily tell a joke about Eni, I would return the joke. Eni told me that I shouldn't have done that, but I could see her hold back her laughter along with the other guests, but I'm tired of Eni being walked over.

""No thank you, this food isn't my preference"" and everyone moves on. It's not like she was trying to pick and choose what the MIL cooks, she just simply doesn't want to eat it.",12,0,2617,2617,"My husband (23) and I (21) both come form different cultures for example I am actually an immigrat and only moved to America when I was just 12 years old.

There is alot of things my husband and his family does differently than mine, things that I'm not quite accustomed to.

One being how they prepare and season their food, to me its just super bland and the stuff the choose of food combinations just doesn't seem to go together.

For example My mil > (mother in law) puts mayo on literally everything I even seen her make a tortilla pizza as mayo as her base which she offered to me. 

Each time she offers me food I always make up some kinda excuse to avoid eating it and try to be as polite as possible about it.

But unfortunately for me after I invited her to dinner she felt compelled to do the same for me even when I told her it's not necessary.

The next day after the dinner we had together she started making plans with my husband, when my husband brought it up to me I told him I really didn't want to go to which he replied my mom's food is not that bad could you please just deal with it for one day.

Now in most cases I would've just suck it up un order to maintain a good relationship with my mil but I'm pregnant in my first trimester and am feeling extra nauseous, I honestly don't think I'd be able to keep the food down in the condition I'm in.

My husband grew up eating her good which is maybe why he doesn't think it's that bad, I mean even my family thinks so when my mom invited her over for a family get together she brought some pasta which sauce tasted like a whole package of ketchup was dump in it. 

I ended up vanting to my sisters and mom about the issue and they all give me the advice to just be honest and my mom even said that if I don't be honest now it's something I'll have to deal with for the rest of my life. 

So I decided to call her and express to her that I'm not accustomed to eating the type of foods she is use to making and since I'm pregnant it'll be really hard for me to swallow because of my nausea, I even offered to teach her the recipes from my homeland that she seemed to really enjoy.

It didn't go to well she was really offended and told me that she'll never cook for my ungrateful ass again and told my husband.

My husband is really disappointed in me because he felt like I should've just pretended to keep the peace and is upset that now my mil doesn't even want to invite me over again.

I feel super bad now and seriously want to know if I'm the asshole in this situation or if I was being too mean or disrespectful.

Am I in the wrong?


Update 

I have invited my mother in law out to a tea Cafe and spoke to her in person.

I was able to explain myself better and I choose not to back down on me not liking the type of foods she cooks.

I'm sorry but like this is my life and I'm choosing not to live the rest of my future being pressured into eating foods I do not like and am also choosing to live my relationship based on honesty.

I had an honest discussion with my mil and explained to her that I love her as a person and appreciate the time and effort she puts into making my husband and I food but I honestly do not like the type of food she chooses to make.

I explained to her that it doesn't make her any less of a person or a bad cook it's just my personal preferences.

She took it extremely well this time and apologized for insulting me and told me that she never been the best cook and would love to take me up on my offer to learn some meals from my homeland.

I ended up suggesting that we take cooking classes together and she loved the idea. 

I think the little bump in the road gave us a stronger bond and I am glad we were able to patch things up.

I personally don't think the advice I was getting from the majority of this sub was good advice and would recommend to anyone in my situation to be honest and kind.

I even made it known to my mother in law that I'd myself would appreciate the same kinda honestly coming from me and if she ever disliked food I made or even a gift I gave to please let me know so I can make or get something she'd enjoy.

She even made jokes about previous gifts I got her lol.",2617,"Jelly_Sky1990","Ok_Being_Here",0

While I was waiting to exit the airplane, the person sitting in the seat next to where I was standing asked me “have the rules changed “and I pretended not to hear him because I had headphones on and I didn’t say anything to him. Then he got up and said, “why don’t you go back to the back and wait like everyone else.” I didn’t respond again but this time there was a lady behind me who said she needed to catch her connecting flight that was already boarding. The guy then said “well the rules havent changed but if you want to be a jerk go ahead.” 

The lady who had the connecting flight definitely had a valid reason to “cut” in line, but when was this ever a rule lol? I don’t think I did anything wrong because everyone who I “skipped” could have gotten up and waited in the aisle, so AITA here?

Ballsy move. She's not married to your brother but still making demands?  Wowza, lol! That's entitlement on a new level.

The only reason her son was crying over this is because she told him *alllll* about it.  This is her fault. I hope your brother realizes what kind of person she is in time.

NTA.  Hope you and your nephew (and best friend/ex-SIL) have a really wonderful time!",3885,0,1706,1706,"Am I The Asshole?
I (28f) and husband (30M) do not have kids. We both have decent paying jobs and a real estate. That said we love to travel and many times also pay & invite our families to go with us.
My brother (26M) married and had my nephew (4m) with my middle school best friend (28F). Yes, he married my best friend and we are still best friends. They had my nephew and years later divorced.

To the Point: My brother started dating his new GF we will call her Ashley. They’ve been together for around 9 ish months. They’re not engaged or married. She has a son who is 5, we will call him John. I’ve only met John a handful of times. He’s a nice kid but I don’t really know him. I only know Ashley on an first name basis in a way. We talk occasionally but nothing in depth.

I invited my ex SIL& nephew to Disney this summer for 6 days. 2 days in Disney, 1 in Universal. The remaining days would be chill/Orlando days.
We are paying for them to go. I’ve always wanted to take nephew to Disney since he was smaller. He loves Mickey! We didn’t tell him in front of John or Ashley. 
But it made it back to Ashley that we are taking him. She confronts me at a family dinner on the side& tells me she’s upset we are not including her child and that he should have been invited. She said he doesn’t feel like he fits in/ is family and that is excluding him from Disney has made him cry all night. I was so shocked.

We are easily paying $2k for my nephew & best friend to go. Tickets, airfare, lodging, and of course some toys. 

I blew up. I told her that I didn’t even know her or her kid. They have only been around for a few months & he’s not my nephew. I told her I didn’t like the entitled mentality and to make it a point I would make sure to exclude her from all future family gatherings. She left crying. My brother and parents are all upset with me. That I’m excluding this child& isolated them. I told them if they’d like to pay for them I don’t mind them tagging along but they all said “You have more means than us”. They’re not doing great financially which is why I didn’t ask in the beginning. She made a huge FB post and everyone is siding with her. 

Did I go too far? Should I have offered to include them? AITA?

My in laws are so overbearing. Like if I go and take a shower, they are knocking on the door within 3 minutes to check on me. If I go to the bedroom to have a minute to myself, they are yelling up to me within 5 minutes to see if I'm good. If I say I need to go for a walk to clear my head, they follow me and make it a family thing. If I want to go site see they immediately get ready to go too and coerce us to go to the sites they think I will enjoy, versus what I would actually like. They sit there and talk to me and won't let me go to bed until after midnight and then they are up knocking on the door at 6am to get me and my fiance downstairs for coffee. And they literally do not stop talking from sun up to sun down.

I'm an introvert. I need space to refill my social bar and since I've been here, I haven't had a moment to myself. I mean not even being able to take a shower without being harassed is pissing me the fuck off. I've talked to my fiance about it several times and have told him more than once I need ""me time"". I need to stop being followed. I need to decompress. His way of combating this was to be up my ass 24/7 and continuously asking if I'm okay or to bitch to me about how annoyed he is becoming. Not helping at all. I've told him that. But after being followed when I was on the phone and having his mother try talking over the conversation I was having, it was the final straw. I packed my stuff and went to a hotel by myself. The $250 of my money to get home was now spent because I needed to get away before I lost it. My fiance knew I was beyond touched out and I warned him this was going to happen but apparently he didn't believe me. So now he's shocked that I would do this and make everything awkward for him and spend my portion of the trip money. AITA?

ETA: I mentioned to my in laws directly a few times that I needed space to decompress. Even when stating I needed to go on a walk to clear my head, they took it as an invitation to come along, despite me stating I needed space. Or like when I went to the bedroom, I announced it to the entire room that I needed a minute, and they proceeded to continuously yell up to me to make sure I was good. So they were fully aware that I was getting touched out but it seems like in their head that meant that they needed to helicopter and make sure I was okay by tagging along and watching me. We had plenty of money to get home. We set aside a specific set of money for the gas back. Me spending my set aside money for the gas back did not in any way leave us stranded here.",2917,"Fun_Macaroon9841","Fabulous_Meet_2065",0

"AITA For Telling My Mother In Law That I Don't Like Her Food","big YTA. there's being honest-- it sounds like a simple ""sorry, i don't actually like mayo"" at the next meal you have together would cover a lot of ground with the foods she makes for you... and then there's calling your MIL to tell her you don't like her cooking, but you can teach her to cook better. calling someone just to insult them is not okay.",10,0,2617,2617,"My husband (23) and I (21) both come form different cultures for example I am actually an immigrat and only moved to America when I was just 12 years old.

There is alot of things my husband and his family does differently than mine, things that I'm not quite accustomed to.

One being how they prepare and season their food, to me its just super bland and the stuff the choose of food combinations just doesn't seem to go together.

For example My mil > (mother in law) puts mayo on literally everything I even seen her make a tortilla pizza as mayo as her base which she offered to me. 

Each time she offers me food I always make up some kinda excuse to avoid eating it and try to be as polite as possible about it.

But unfortunately for me after I invited her to dinner she felt compelled to do the same for me even when I told her it's not necessary.

The next day after the dinner we had together she started making plans with my husband, when my husband brought it up to me I told him I really didn't want to go to which he replied my mom's food is not that bad could you please just deal with it for one day.

Now in most cases I would've just suck it up un order to maintain a good relationship with my mil but I'm pregnant in my first trimester and am feeling extra nauseous, I honestly don't think I'd be able to keep the food down in the condition I'm in.

My husband grew up eating her good which is maybe why he doesn't think it's that bad, I mean even my family thinks so when my mom invited her over for a family get together she brought some pasta which sauce tasted like a whole package of ketchup was dump in it. 

I ended up vanting to my sisters and mom about the issue and they all give me the advice to just be honest and my mom even said that if I don't be honest now it's something I'll have to deal with for the rest of my life. 

So I decided to call her and express to her that I'm not accustomed to eating the type of foods she is use to making and since I'm pregnant it'll be really hard for me to swallow because of my nausea, I even offered to teach her the recipes from my homeland that she seemed to really enjoy.

It didn't go to well she was really offended and told me that she'll never cook for my ungrateful ass again and told my husband.

My husband is really disappointed in me because he felt like I should've just pretended to keep the peace and is upset that now my mil doesn't even want to invite me over again.

I feel super bad now and seriously want to know if I'm the asshole in this situation or if I was being too mean or disrespectful.

Am I in the wrong?


Update 

I have invited my mother in law out to a tea Cafe and spoke to her in person.

I was able to explain myself better and I choose not to back down on me not liking the type of foods she cooks.

I'm sorry but like this is my life and I'm choosing not to live the rest of my future being pressured into eating foods I do not like and am also choosing to live my relationship based on honesty.

I had an honest discussion with my mil and explained to her that I love her as a person and appreciate the time and effort she puts into making my husband and I food but I honestly do not like the type of food she chooses to make.

I explained to her that it doesn't make her any less of a person or a bad cook it's just my personal preferences.

She took it extremely well this time and apologized for insulting me and told me that she never been the best cook and would love to take me up on my offer to learn some meals from my homeland.

I ended up suggesting that we take cooking classes together and she loved the idea. 

I think the little bump in the road gave us a stronger bond and I am glad we were able to patch things up.

I personally don't think the advice I was getting from the majority of this sub was good advice and would recommend to anyone in my situation to be honest and kind.

I even made it known to my mother in law that I'd myself would appreciate the same kinda honestly coming from me and if she ever disliked food I made or even a gift I gave to please let me know so I can make or get something she'd enjoy.

She even made jokes about previous gifts I got her lol.",2617,"champagneformyrealfr","Ok_Being_Here",0

"AITA for not wanting to attend my own birthday party?","NTA. Why do they insist on surprising you but everyone else gets to choose what they want? You need to stop trying to be nice and speak plainly. Tell them you want to be in on the plan for your birthday from now on. You do not like the surprises at all. If you don’t tell them they will continue doing what you don’t want.",2,0,167,167,"I recently found out that my group of friends is planning a surprise birthday party for me. Now before everyone starts getting at me for being ungrateful, hear me out. In the past, my friends have thrown me a few surprise events. When I got married, my bridesmaids insisted on throwing me a surprise bridal shower and bachelorette even though I insisted that I hate surprises. I’m ok not knowing details, but I wanted to at least know the gist of what was going on. I was kept in the dark until the day of, and I was thrown a tea party - something that wouldn’t even be on the top 50 things I would like to do. I felt horrible because I genuinely didn’t enjoy it, but couldn’t say anything because I knew how expensive the venue was. I was grateful that they planned it, so I thanked them and just reminded them that I’m not a huge fan of surprises. Another time, they threw me a surprise picnic birthday party, because they know I love picnics. They didn’t realize that the reason I love them is that I love cooking and packing the food beforehand - so I didn’t get to be a part of what makes me love picnics because it was a surprise. Again, I told them I’d like to not have surprises anymore. Fast forward to this year, I caught on that they were trying to plan a surprise party through my husband. Again, they chose something I really would rather not do, at least for my birthday. I had to get my husband to lead the conversation to avoid that activity, and suggest something I actually want to do. But from a bowling/arcade joint, they went ahead and reserved only the arcade without asking which I would like. And instead of splitting the birthday person’s expenses equally like we do every birthday (It would have only been $3 more per person), they pressured my husband into paying my whole share. I’m grateful that they’re going out of their way to spend their time and money on me, but I really don’t understand why they keep trying to surprise me with things without even trying to find out what I want to do. It honestly feels like everyone is wasting their time and money. I’m also the only one they ever try to surprise - everyone else gets asked what they want to do.

AITA for feeling this way?

ETA: A lot of people are saying my husband should have put his foot down, but he’s honestly not that close with my friends and didn’t want to cause a scene. He said more than he normally would have even in his own group of friends. In a perfect world, he would have done a lot of what the comments are saying, but he went above and beyond out of his comfort zone to steer the conversation at least to the venue I would enjoy.

ETA 2: To the people asking why I didn’t just plan my own party, I simply didn’t want to go out of my way to celebrate my birthday this year. The one thing I wanted was an upscale dinner that my husband already planned as a date. One of my friends asked me how I wanted to celebrate, and I told her that I don’t need to do anything for it this year. They decided after this that they would throw me a surprise. The activities that he and I suggested were simply things that I’ve been wanting to do if we were to get a large group together.",167,"Big-Question3105","lehiu",0

That isn't the reason my parents divorced, it was just a joke about a coincidence, but she said it was a horrible thing to say about my sisters.

My grandmother then joked that it was the opposite, because it implied my dad wanted daughters and only stayed with a woman long enough to get one, so as long as she doesn't have another kid or only has sons he'll stick around waiting for a girl. We both started laughing, and my dad's wife stared at us silently and then got up and left the room. At this point I started to wonder if I crossed a line.

I do find this funny because Heather and her kids (her little demons as I call them in my head) were no great family addition.

SIL is Sophie, she’s 26F and married to my husband’s brother. I’m 29F.

Sophie has been married to my BIL since late 2021. Whenever we have had holidays she has spent it with her family, and my husband and I only go back to his hometown during the holidays - so I don’t know her well.

Anyway we have a holiday coming up in just over a month. For the first time Sophie’s parents will be away so she will be celebrating with us.

That’s all background. As is the fact that my MIL is a trained patissier. I promise it’s relevant.

I happened to be in town this week and MIL started putting together her list of ingredients for the stuff she will make. She was consulting me, and my husband’s sister Zara, about what to make and also delegated a couple of things to each of us.

Sophie came into the living room and said “oh I can definitely make better brownies, tartlets and whatever else than [my name]!”

Now my MIL takes desserts very seriously. I said okay you can make that stuff but MIL said no we need to have the nicest sweets. There was a back and forth and Sophie suggested what I can only describe as a bake off.

So we made brownies, tiramisu, lemon meringue and the family judged between us and everyone voted in my favour. 

Sophie got mad at me and said I’d hidden the fact that I know how to bake from her to which Zara said neither of us really bake when MIL is around because she’s amazing but that we both *can* if we need to.

Now Sophie is mad at me for both hiding my ability from her and for purposefully embarrassing her in front of our in laws. I think she’s stupid - she wanted the silly bake off right up until she lost, it’s not my fault she has an ego

My husband agrees with me but his brother called me said I should try to “be accommodating to her”. I reconsidered and told her I would be her MOH if she covers half of the responsibilities, eg planning the bachelorette party. He said he would get back to me.

The next day, she calls me and asks me why I’m being so difficult. She says I’m the only one in the bridal party not working and that I should step up. I told her again that I’m on maternity leave taking care of a baby and it is actually even more demanding than full time work. She ended the call quite upset.

"AITA for suggesting my stepson (16M) moves out?","YTA What happened with your SDs came about organically. Sounds like they figured it out themselves and so they're both happy. What you're doing/have done is because you feel it's unfair that your son doesn't have his 'own room'. That's not your stepson's fault and not his job/responsibility to fix. You can pretty it all up with word salad to make it seem like you're looking out for everyone but you said it yourself. 'It's unfair that all the older kids but my son have their own rooms at one of their parents house.' 

Oh and look! That would also probably get rid of that close bond that your husband and his oldest son have at the same time! Woohoo!!! Two birds and all that. ",80,0,2864,2864,"My husband and I have 6 children total and live in 4 bedroom house. We have two sons together (8 & 6), I have a son from a previous relationship (15), and I have 3 step children (20F, 16M & 16F). We live in a 4 bedroom house and for most the time we lived there we had 2 kids per room with the youngest boys sharing, the older boys sharing and the girls sharing. 

Things changed a couple years ago. My oldest stepdaughter finished school and is attending university locally. The girls decided at this point that instead of sharing a bedroom at their dads and sharing a bedroom at their mums, they would each take 1 room as their permanent bedroom. So the 16 yr old lives with us full time and the 20 yr old lives with her mum full time. They both visit the other parents house regularly. 

My 16 yr old stepson has his own bedroom at his mum's house but still splits time between each parents house mostly 50/50. My son lives full time with us as he doesn't have much of a relationship with his dad. My son and stepson do not get on that well and they can often be heard screaming at each other in their bedroom. 

Recently, I asked my stepson why he doesn't move to live full time with his mum so he and my son can have a similar arrangement as their sisters. This way both of the boys would have their own rooms. He would obviously still visit like his older sister does and we could figure something out like a futon instead of a bed in their room so my son has more space when stepson's not there. 

My stepson overreacted to my suggestion and is trying to make out like I'm kicking him out, when really I'm just thinking of a better use of space. It's unfair that all the older kids but my son have their own rooms at one of their parents house. My son likes the idea and has brought it up to his stepbrother a few more times since I originally suggested it and it has caused arguments between them. He now seems to be considering it. 

My husband is angry with me for suggesting his son moving permanently to his mums. He thinks that he and his son would have a less close relationship if this happens (my husband favours his oldest son over our boys). He also thinks I'm making his son feel like he's being forced out. However, it was his daughters already doing the same thing that gave me the idea because it worked out well for them and they both seem happier. I'm also not forcing this to happen I was just suggesting it to him, it would be completely up to him. Is this a good plan or AITA for bringing it up?",2864,"rbrancher2","brgtail1735",1

My brother (20m) seems to have clung on to that and thinks he will have twins when he has kids. He seems weirdly proud of it (idk why, having twins sounds like a nightmare). He was talking about it recently and i told him that its likely he will never have twins since its only really hereditry for women.

I was raised well so I was honest and said no these are for me.

"AITA for getting upset when my boyfriend talks badly about my family?","NTA.

""He's amazing at everything else"", except for the parts where he insisted your family sucks despite you improving your relationship with them (even though family is important) and your self-started successful business which he wants you to abandon because it isn't that important.

Yeah, sounds like a real prize. ",3,0,2,2,"Backstory: My (25F) boyfriend (26M) currently have a long distance relationship. We met back in high-school and started dating about 6months ago. He lost his job a month ago and I have a business that I can't move. We have been discussing who will be the one to move and yesterday after weighing all options put my foot down and said that I can't be the one that moves because of my business. There isn't nearly as much for me to do with my business where he lives compared to where I live. It doesn't make sense to move and he can do his same job anywhere. 

Now to the family part. He and his family have always been close whereas my family wasn't always the best and we had a falling out for about a year and just regained contact about 9months ago and things are going good so far and I'm happy. My boyfriend however keeps saying that his family is better than mine and gets upset when I defend my family because he feels they don't deserve it. He said he worries about our future children being around them (I'm not even pregnant) and said they don't compare to his family. He has only met my patents once for a few hours and they were nothing but kind to him. I express to him that what he is saying is hurting me but he feels it needs to be discussed because one of us has to move and family is a factor and he's just being logical and then just keeps repeating everything that upset me right after I told him it upset me. I understand needing to talk about it but I feel there is a better way to talk about a sensitive topic than the harsh and abrasive way he is. 

He also devalued my business that I'm super successful in and wants me to just throw away 3.5years of hard work and attempt to rebuild it where he lives if I even can or just get another job because ""my job is not that difficult and I don't even need a degree for it and it's just a job."" My job isn't just a job to me. I feel he should be more supportive of me and my decision to reconnect with my family rather than constantly bringing it down when he wasn't even there for the bad parts. And I feel he should be proud of me for the business I built and how successful I am. He also called me selfish and closed minded for saying I won't leave my business.
