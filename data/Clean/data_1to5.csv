"AITA for not helping my brother babysit?","NTA

You are not obligated to give up your life and future to help support your family.",1,0,189,189,"For context, I moved to the US in 6th grade. My parents did not know any english so the whole application process is done by me and a math teacher. They were really unhappy about me leaving China but gave consent, and they paid for the school, which is 20000$ yearly and a boarding school, and told me I need to come back. There was one relative taking care of me there. Our family is pretty well off since my dad and mom is both graduates from the Beijing University, the best university in China. Their job roughly have 10000$ per month pay. However, I've gone to college at US and moved to Iceland, which was a very complicated process and took me 9 months. My parents was very unhappy about it, however, and asked me to come back

I told them that I will be staying in Iceland since it is a really good place, and that I am really sorry I cannot come back, and that I will help them(my parents only, specifically mentioned not my brother who bullied me) if they have issues, and things did not escalate that much.

Now my brother's wife had a baby and then she died from the birth, and my parents is asking me to come back to china since my brother is broke. I told them it could only be 3 months at most, since, even though my boss is VERY lenient, he still got a company to manage. They said it is a long term job. I politely declined, telling my parents that I am settled in Iceland and I will not be coming back too long. I told them that they can give financial aid to my brother, and that I could also give it. They declined to give financial aid for whatever reason, and I still gave 1000$. The parents then accused me of ""betraying"" china and the family, and all of my family except my uncle is shutting me out and accusing me of being selfish. They are saying I am richer than most of my family and I don't even have a wife and that I am selfish and a liar, which is true, so am I being selfish? And am I being an AH by lying that ""I will come back""?

"AITA for kicking my friend out after she said I was treating my dog like a ""servant""?","Obviously NTA. Your golden sounds like a sweet baby and will be a much better friend to you than this person! If someone was rude to my dog I’d tell them off too. Also, I’m in a 55k+ member golden retriever group and can’t remember ever seeing one named Nala. Not sure what she’s on about.",143,0,6330,6330,"I F27 recently moved into my new house. I have a golden retriever named Nala and she is the sweetest. 

I'm Deaf, too. That bit is important. When I moved in, I had a bit of trouble having flashing light doorbells put in and there was a while I had to go without. My friends and family know to give me a call when they drop by instead of ringing the doorbell but unfortunately I have missed many a package this way. 

For some reason, Nala caught onto this. At one point she began letting me know when someone was at the door. She'd do this in multiple ways. If I was in the living room where I can see the front door,  she'd go and paw at the door, or if I was upstairs she'd come and gently headbutt me  to let me know someone's there. It took me a while to catch on to what she was trying to do, though. 

And now, even though I  have my doorbell installed she still does it. I did not teach her how to do any of this. She just decided to help me out lol.  

I brought a friend over for the first time recently. This is the first time she's met Nala as well. The first thing she comments on is how I named her Nala, because  apparently everyone and their grandma names their golden Nala. Lion King was my favorite movie growing up, sue me. 

Then I showed her a video of Nala pawing at the door because it got a bit awkward after that comment. It's usually a great ice breaker. She laughed and thought it was cute. I showed her another one. She asked me why Nala was doing that and I explained. 

She doesn't say anything for a minute and then goes ""So, she's basically your servant? Is she just here to get the door?"" 

I was thoroughly done with her judgmental ass by that point and I just asked her to leave. She left, but she did message me afterwards saying I was rude as fuck kicking her out after she travelled all the way to see me, and that how else was she supposed to think of my dog with videos like that?",6330,"JuuliusCaesar69","day6fan",0

"AITA if I think it’s weird that 22F girlfriend will occasionally get bathed by her mom?","NTA Indian-American, so not by personal experience but in my mom’s generation this was not unusual for situations like helping the bride get bathed/ready, the idea being that she shouldn’t have to lift a finger (probably for the last time in her life…) and to keep her henna undisturbed. Then kids or maybe someone who is hurt.  It would be weird to do this for no reason. I think her mom is infantilizing her and she just thinks it’s normal",51,0,364,364,"So I was talking to my girlfriend last night and the topic of showering/how we shower came up. She’s at home for spring break from college and she just casually mentions that her mom bathed her last night.

I did a double take and I’m like “huh?” And she got defensive and got mad at me for being judgmental. She got mad at me and said I was judging her for her culture (She’s Indian) and that this was normal in Indian households. I have lots of Indian friends and I never once heard of them getting bathed as fully grown adults.

I thought maybe I was being culturally insensitive so I googled about it but found nothing. After our talk, the next morning she sent me multiple paragraphs about how I will never understand her culture and that I should just accept her.

For context, my girlfriend has really strict traditional indian parents who are helicopter parents in every sense of the word. They are also super toxic and judgmental. I understand that Indian/immigrant parents are different/more strict than white American parents, but I definitely think her parents are a little too controlling and weird. However as a result I think she is quite sheltered and frustratingly naïve at times.

Of course I will always support her and aim to not judge her, but AITA for responding the way I did? I do think that’s a little strange…",364,"SnooPets8873","Healthy-Quarter-5723",0

"Game Suggestions Please","You could try Valheim, me and my buddies enjoyed it a lot",1,0,0,0,"Hi All,

My buddies and I got into Fortnite after work during the pandemic and we have fallen off big time regarding consistently hopping on and playing together. We have been discussing that we are all ready for a new game and want something more relaxing. Over our discussion, we have concluded that we are looking for a 4-player campaign or pve type of game that we can enjoy casually and outside of the popular BR format. We tried sea of thieves this week and unfortunately I got super seasick lmfao. 

General Specifications:

\- Ideally cross platform, we have 2 on xbox, 1 on pc, and 1 on ps5

\- PvE or Campaign style game no BR

We have tossed around titles like Destiny 2 but my hesitation is that I've heard destiny 2 is an insane grind and can feel very repetitive. Minecraft also comes to mind but that would take some convincing as the guys are all 27+ and have never tried minecraft. Honestly if a game like Dragon Age Inquisition had a 4 player cross platform campaign that would be exactly what I think we would enjoy. Heck, we would be on 2K23 or FIFA right now running a group franchise or campaign right now if they had cross-platform.

Let me know if there are any games out there that would work. Any thoughts are appreciated",0,"Doctor_Grizz","plow_poon",0

"AITA for switching out my daughter's school lunches behind my wife's back?","I’m white and our kids go to a predominantly white school and I pack boring, non-cultural lunches and even then some of them are apparently *mortifying* for my 12 year old. When he told me he ate his lunchable with it on his lap under the table know what I did? Never packed him a lunchable again. 

Tell your wife that how she handles these “little problems” your daughter is sharing will 100% impact if your daughter hides or shares her bigger problems. Ask her what kind of relationship she wants to have with her daughter. And ask her if she wants your daughter to be ashamed or proud of her culture.",1,0,4439,4439,"My wife Sara (36F) and I (35M) have an 11 year old daughter named Lily. Lily had begun attending 6th grade in September, but this problem only recently became a major issue. Sara is Indian and makes great dishes that the whole family enjoys, and tends to pack these lunches for Lily as well. She typically packs Lily a rice with dal in a container or something similar, which she had no issues with in elementary school.

However, recently Lily came sobbing to her mom and I about the lunches she took. The kids at school had been making fun of her food, which absolutely made my heart break. I had struggled with the same thing at her age (I come from a Chinese family and would always take homemade food to school too) and when I asked her if she wanted us to report the problem, she begged us not to so she wouldn't be called a ""snitch"" or worse. When Sara heard this, she simply contacted the principal, which I didn't want to resort to at first, and left the issue, telling Lily she wouldn't be buying school lunch and to just ignore the other kids.

The same problem occured every day, Lily would be coming home feeling extremely upset and there were even times Sara would yell at Lily for not even touching her school lunch. We both had talks with Lily about her culture and how she should be proud, have contacted the schools, but the school is ignorant of the issue (they simply had a talk with the parents, and ended it there) and Lily isn't budging. I don't want her to starve, because so many days she doesn't even eat her lunch. I know how brutal middle schoolers can be, and I didn't want Lily to feel insecure or upset even if it meant making her take other lunches, but Sara refuses to make other lunches.

I began to make other lunches for Lily, like sandwiches, or sometimes mac n' cheese, so she'd feel more comfortable eating it in school in front of her classmates as a final resort when nothing else worked. I would take Lily's lunch for myself at work and pack her own lunch early in the morning, which she finished and seemed happier when coming home daily after. However, this only worked for about 2 weeks until Sara found out and was infuriated. She said I was denying Lily her culture and she needed to learn to stop being insulted by other kids, telling me I'm raising Lily to get whatever she wants. Is Sara right? AITA?

EDIT: Bringing this post and topic up tonight, I'll post an update when I can. Hopefully this is enough to convince Sara- if not, I'll do what other comments said and just keep packing Lily's lunch or let her pick.

I have to go to a food bank to get free food because I'm struggling financially. That's not really the point but just some context as to why I have a lot of different foods that I might not eat. I get giant boxes with random food so sometimes I end up with food I don't like, or an excess of one type of food I know I won't go through before it turns. 

I recently got a food box and they gave me a *ton* of the same kind of stuff. I got multiple packs of tortillas that I won't ever use, way too many jalapeños, a ton of avocados, and a bunch of cans of chili. I know I'm not gonna eat it all on my own. 

I want to give some of the excess food to my neighbor so he can use it and it won't go to waste. But it just so happens that the exact foods I don't need are jalapeños, tortillas, avocados, and canned chili. And my neighbor is Mexican. 

It seems super stereotypical and rude to give him those foods all together and I'm afraid he'll figure I'm being racist or something. But I genuinely just have a lot of stuff I don't need!!

He has a younger brother who recently got engaged. I have known his brother’s girlfriend for 4 years. We’re not extremely close but we hang out whenever there’s a family get together.

Anyways, for her bridal party she’s asked me to be the Maid of Honour. She has four other bridesmaids composed of cousins and old school friends. I told her that I’m very grateful that she has asked me but unfortunately I don’t have the time to do all the things expected of a MOH. I just had my first baby in November and it’s a lot. She has expressed wanting a bridal shower, bachelorette party, etc.

I told her I can just be a regular bridesmaid. She seemed fine but afterwards, my husband told me that she was venting to my brother and telling him that I’m being cold to her. According to her, she thinks I’m lying by saying I’m too busy because I’m on maternity leave and that I have “all the time in the world” and all her other friends work full time. 

My husband agrees with me but his brother called me said I should try to “be accommodating to her”. I reconsidered and told her I would be her MOH if she covers half of the responsibilities, eg planning the bachelorette party. He said he would get back to me.

The next day, she calls me and asks me why I’m being so difficult. She says I’m the only one in the bridal party not working and that I should step up.

I do not think he forgot to add the other children. He likely added you to the will after the other kids were born.",1,0,2723,2723,"My mother moved me during the divorce and against my father's wishes. I was 8 at the time. She moved 3 hours away because she needed a support network.

Clearly she was wrong but I was a kid and adapted. My father started legal proceedings against my mother and the whole thing took 6 years.

I would visit my father for half of summer vacation and many holidays. But I really loved my life with my mom.

When I was 14, my father basically threatened to have my mother arrested if she didn't let him have custody of me.

So against my own wishes, I was forced to move back to my dad's home full time.

I hated it here and I essentially lived a separate life from my dad and his family.

When I was 16, my grandad died and had left his company to his two sons (my dad and uncle) and me. We all got a third ownership. 

My dad and uncle had more kids but my grandfather never updated the will. My family says it's because he got too old to remember. 

So here is where I think I'm the asshole. Since I was 16, I didn't know any better and my dad and uncle just ran the company themselves.

But when I turned 18, my dad and uncle talked to me about splitting the company 50/50 between them so they could split it fairly among all the grandkids instead.

I would get a cash payout of $300k for my share.

But I talked to a lawyer on my own and refused to agree. In addition, I asked for my share of the profits since the past two years and that I'd be part of the business going forward while I was going to college.

This has made life extremely difficult for my dad. My uncle is extremely resentful that only one grandchild gets a huge stake. And my dad is now paying me my share of the profits for the past two years out of his own pocket just to keep the peace.

AITA? Maybe if I was on better terms with my father, I'd be open to their plan.

One of them was a 12-year-old boy who brought a doll-type thing which glowed and made noises if you pressed a button. We opened the present later after the party, and even though my son was happy to receive it, I noticed that the toy had a cracked shoulder.

The next day, when the boy came to play with my son and the other kids, I asked him who brought the gift, and he said he did it. I showed him the broken part and lightly scolded him. I simply told him that if he was going to spend money buying something, he should've checked the thing. I gave it back to him and told him to ask the store to replace it since it's broken. I thought it was a good life lesson and that he'd remember this. It would help him when he buys something later on. It would teach him not to waste his money.

However, later that evening his mom called me and told me that I was very rude to her son. She said and I quote ""if someone gives you a gift, you just appreciate it and don't say anything even if it's not that good, especially when it's a kid"" Turns out, he bought it with his own pocket money, and he put a lot of thought into it.

So do you.",22,0,29168,29168,"Background: I'm (F23) one of only a few female students in a male-dominated course. Furthermore, I am at a highly prestigious university and I haven't really gotten along with the guys on my course. They are all very competitive and I just don't really enjoy their company - everything turns into a pissing contest, and they definitely take me less seriously because I'm a woman. I stopped interacting with them beyond the mere minimum and choose to hang out with other people. 

Anyway:

I did well in our recent exams (I topped two out of four exams we had so far). Our prof congratulated me during class (I wouldn't have advertised this myself). Ever since then, my interactions with a specific group of male classmates have gotten weird. They're now outright rude and challenge me aggressively in class discussions. We recently had some presentations and one of them chose to do theirs on, to put it simply, ""pretty privilege"" - they specifically pointed to two papers that suggested that pretty female students get overscored in assessments. The other guys in the group snickered and one even gave me a wink. Afterwards, I heard them in the hallway joking that ""they had experience with that themselves"".

I've been seeing a PhD student within our department for a month. He has literally nothing to do with our course. Well, we ran into one of my course mates A together. The next day in class his friend B asked me if ""my boyfriend"" helped me with exams. He said this intentionally loudly and in front of the professor, who heard this. I replied that I don't have a boyfriend (cause he's not my bf), but then B pointed out that he had run into me with the PhD student, making a point to say his name (the prof knows him). I just replied that we're only friends.

They didn't let up - I heard that they discussed this thing in two more classes, in earshot of the professors. Both times they suggested I got help for my exams ( I wasn't even seeing him then). I didn’t confront them, but this has been causing me so much anxiety - even without the exam accusations, I worked hard to get here and I don’t want to be known among the faculty for my dating life.

I raised this issue with my supervisor, without the intention of taking it any further, but I wanted her advice as a woman in academia. She convinced me to let her email their supervisors ""to remind them of proper conduct"" and described their treatment of an ""unnamed female student"". She didn't name me, but they figured it out. They confronted me after class and asked my why I would report their “silly joke“. Apparently, their supervisors are now very cold towards them and less interested in helping. It’s not a formal complaint - only their supervisors know - but one of them, C, said his supervisor writes the reports for his financial aid/scholarship and it was my fault if he lost out on that.

I now feel a bit embarrassed and this was compounded by a friend telling me I took it to far cause C shouldn't lose out on his scholarship. So, reddit - AITA?

"AITA For telling my MIL not to meddle with my and my fiancé's sex life?","NTA. And absolutely concur that you need to leave this relationship asap, run!",1,0,1135,1135,"Me (19F) and my soon-to-be husband (21M) got engaged after 4 years together.

I was really young when we first started dating and the nagging of my MIL, wanting us to have kids early, always bothered me. I took my complaints to my fiancé but he dismissed me saying that i should ""understand his mother's ways"". I didn't get her hopes up about me having kids, because i always said that i wanted to mature enough to be able to raise a kid.

As i said, i just dismissed her nagging, until last week.

My fiancé came home from work (that btw he works with his mother), saying: ""I was with mom all that in the office,and after she told me some things i came to the conclusion that you should stop taking your birth control pills"". Unbelievable. Didn't even want to argue about something this ridiculous.

Time passed and we didn't touch this issue anymore.

The weekend came, and we went to visit my MIL's house, she took me to her room saying she needed to have a word with me and my fiancé.

She sat down on the bed and said: ""I had a discussion with Luiz (my fiancé's name), and i told him about my concern with you guys not having children at the appropriate age. Who knows if you're going to be able to have children with this disease of yours? As for now, he will no longer allow you to buy the birth control pills per my request""

(He never buyed them for me, i work 9 hours a day and everything i buy for myself comes from my money)

About ""my disease"": It's a disease that all the women in my father's side had: Uterus Cancer. My great-great-grandmother passed due to it, my great-grandmother too and my grandma had it after giving birth to my father, but the doctors took the uterus out before the cancer could spread further. My grandma was always cautious with me. Never had any issues, and i go to the gynecologist 2 times a year to do exams.

 I got enraged, and looked at my fiancé who was sitting beside her, and he just averted his eyes.

""you will regret leaving the thoughts of having kids after your graduation, because god time is now and i got a revelation from the pastor that one of my family members is going to try to have kids and it's not gonna be able to. I'm sure that person is you, and i'm worried for my son. I can't leave this marriage be if your thoughts don't align.""

When she said that last line, i exploded, saying ""Are you so desperate for me to sit on your son's cock and have a baby so what? It's not your business if we're having kids or not or if we're having sex or not, this must be a joke"".

The argument escalated but i don't remember much because i got so enraged that i started trembling and had to go home to calm myself down alone, as i left my fiancé there.

When he came home, he was pissed off saying that i disrespected his mother and that if i didn't apologise he would consider breaking off the engagement. Honestly am not making any effort to set things straight as i'm very offended by everything she said.

There’s a guy who moved into my neighborhood last year who’s kind of a dick on the road. It’s an old neighborhood that’s gotten very popular to live in but the roads are very tiny/narrow and this guy makes it a habit of driving around you if he doesn’t like the speed you’re driving (there are only two lanes so it’s kind of dangerous) and speeding around even though it’s mostly residential. He’s done this to me and my partner, and my father when he came to visit. Even though he seems nice enough when we see him waking by our house it’s always kind of annoyed me. Well, today he must have done this to the wrong person bc when I came out to walk the dog a lady had blocked him in the middle of the st with her suv and was saying in a loud voice “mmmm I’ve got a biiiiiiig dick and I can drive however I want bc mommy said I’m a very special little boy”. Well I just lost it laughing bc - this guy is a pest! And it was funny as hell to see this girl say it to him. She eventually drove off when our other neighbor came out and threatened to call the cops. My neighbor then yelled at me for not helping him with her since she probably had road rage. I told her to mind her own business. I didn’t think I was wrong until my partner came home and said I was wrong too and the guy is our neighbor and I’m just going to cause problems. Idk - this guy has tailgated me and driven around me and other people too and I think he just finally reaped what he sowed.

"AITA for ditching my friend and her toddler at a restaurant because they were late?","NTA she became one of those mothers who thinks that she’s inherently busier and more important because she (presumably) reproduced. It sounds like she doesn’t understand that just because her life revolves around her child that not everyone else’s life revolves around her child. Maybe this is all she has going on and it’s become her entire identity and a personality trait.

There are plenty of people out there who have big responsibilities to manage and know how to not be inconsiderate in balancing those with their friendships.",1,0,5772,5772,"My friend (""Samantha"") is a stay-at-home mom and has a four-year-old daughter (""Katie""). Since her daughter's birth, she always insisted that I go to her place if I ever wanted to hang out. Even though she lives about 45 minutes away from me, I always did it in the beginning because I did value our friendship, and Katie was her first, so I could understand how she'd be stressed with a newborn.

Recently, I started to put my foot down and wanted her to meet me halfway. I felt like her kid (she only has Katie) was old enough to handle being outside and I was tired of driving just to hang at her house. We always picked a place halfway, so I felt like it was doable. 

During the last three hangouts, she was over 30 minutes late, and each time she claimed that she got ""mom privileges"" for being late because she had to wrangle her kid into the car and do other ""mom things"" I wouldn't understand (according to her. I'm childless). 

She asked to hang out this past weekend, and I told her that if she was late again, I'd leave. Lo and behold, the day came and she was late. After 30 minutes, I got up and left, but went to hang in the coffeeshop across the street because I was curious just how late she'd be. She was over an hour late, and when she found out from the waitress that I left, she started to call and text me. 

She said that I was callous and selfish for making her drive 25 minutes away from home with a toddler only to leave, and that she only ever came out for my benefit. I told her that I hang out with multiple friends who bring their kids out with us, and they're never late, so it was pretty shitty to blame being late on Katie (who is a perfectly sweet girl. She's never been a problem during our outings). Samantha just kept pulling the ""you're not a mom so you wouldn't get it"" card. 

I heard later from a mutual friend that Samantha has been blasting me in their mommy group and said I was bullying her for putting her child first. I feel like her reaction wouldn't be so strong unless she was actually upset, so I'm starting to kind of feel like an AH. I mean, she's right that I don't ""get it"" as I don't have children, but I still feel annoyed that she's late and feel justified for leaving. My time is precious too!

Heather has a nephew Kai who is 8. Kai's parents are going through a divorce right now and his mom is already seriously dating this guy who moved in with them. Kai is hating the whole thing. I'm not close to Heather or her family but was dragged along for a family party at her parents house Saturday (I'm 17 and still split time between my parents and was given no choice by my dad). Kai was upset and was talking about how much it sucked. I told him I got it. He said everyone in his family was telling him he should be happy because he wouldn't have to listen to his parents fight anymore and he should be happy they're divorcing. Kai said he wasn't. I told him neither was I. That I knew nobody with divorced parents who wanted them to be divorced or were happy about it. I told him most of my friends have divorced parents and all of them wish it hadn't happened. Heather and her sister overheard what I said to Kai and I got into so much trouble for saying it. They said it was unfair to make him think being unhappy with the divorce is okay and I shouldn't be saying that when I grew my family because of the divorce.

I do find this funny because Heather and her kids (her little demons as I call them in my head) were no great family addition. Most of the time I have to make sure none of my stuff has been broken or stolen and to never ever buy snacks for myself with my money because that stuff will be gone. I also get to hear about them getting suspended from school every time I'm at my dad's.

So I got a lecture and was told I was wrong and acting like a spoiled kid. I decided to just go to my mom's and not listen. Dad told me I should never have told Kai what I did.

"AITA for getting my ex friend kicked out of our friend group due to my service dog?","NTA and I'm glad all your friends yelled at Anna.",2,0,9500,9500,"Hi everyone, 

Update: from what everyone has said I am clearly NTA. Thank you all for your concern and well wishes. Ana and her family have been blocked and I will no longer be in contact with her. 

It was also brought up to me by another user that their was a similar post posted a few weeks ago from a hosts perspective. This is NOT the same post. My situation happened really recently (allot more recent than whatever the previous post was) I’m shocked to hear this has happened befor, but yeah it’s 💯 not related to ours haha


Finally I’ve had a few comments about my dog being “certified” that I want to clarify. I am not from the US so I’m unsure what your guys process is like, but all I mean is that Bailey has gone through the required testing, training and registration to ensure she is legally aloud to be classified as a service animal :) 


I just want to start by saying I’m pretty sure I’m not the A-hole. But my friend and her family are pretty certain that I am. Please bear with me, I’m just wanting some clarity over this situation to make sure I’m not crazy.

I (24 f) have epilepsy. I have a service dog (fully certified) who is trained to help me with my seizures. I have been diagnosed since a child, and I have had my current dog Bailey for 4 years now and she is the bestest girl around. (Before Bailey I had a previous service dog who we had to retire due to age… but having a service animal is by no means new for me). With her being a service dog she is obviously always with me. 

I have a core friend group who hangs out quite often. My one friend; let’s call her Anna) (also 24f) always makes really weird and almost passive aggressive comments about me and Bailey? Ex; dogs shouldn’t come to restaurants, I’m inconveniencing people, etc. she doesn’t get that I legitimately need her for my own safety. It’s not just for show.

My seizures are really regular; for context I actually get two different kinds. My “small ones” are petit Mal seizures. This essentially just looks like I’m zoning out and staring into space. Quite often people who don’t know me wouldn’t even connect this. My “big ones” are my main concern; these are focal seizures where I fully lose consciousness. This can happen a couple times a day for me so it’s obviously really important that I manage it to the best of my abilities. 

Anyways. Our friend Anna wanted to host a games night/appy night type thing at her house. When we there she lost it on me. She told me it was increadibly disrespectful that I showed up with Bailey without asking for permission first. That I can’t just assume people will be happy with a dog always being around. That I should have just stayed home if I couldn’t handle being out for a few hours without Bailey. I tried apologizing and pointing out that I assumed she knew I was bringing her since I’ve never gone anywhere without her. That set her off more. The guys were finally able to calm her down but her “compromise” was I had to put Bailey in the backyard.

I was an idiot and said fine because I didn’t want to inconvenience anyone more or continue stirring the pot. Bailey went out side and I returned inside with my friends. 

I ended up having a seizure, blacking out and smashing my head on the floor. I had to go to the hospital because of how hard I hit my head. 

I guess my friend group absolutely handed Ana her ass calling her hateful, toxic, and a jealous witch. I guess she was trying to say that I passed out for the attention and I got my way like always. Long story short no one wants her around anymore.

Since this happened her, her sister and mom have been blowing up my phone, calling me the ass hole and demanding I fix this situation and it’s honestly getting to me.. so Reddit. AITA?",9500,"bury-me-in-books","throwaway9876402",0

Middle school kids are assholes.  All of them.  Just assholes.  It doesn't matter what they're assholes about, they're just assholes to everyone.  It's not their fault, hormones during puberty are assholes.",1,0,4439,4439,"My wife Sara (36F) and I (35M) have an 11 year old daughter named Lily. Lily had begun attending 6th grade in September, but this problem only recently became a major issue. Sara is Indian and makes great dishes that the whole family enjoys, and tends to pack these lunches for Lily as well. She typically packs Lily a rice with dal in a container or something similar, which she had no issues with in elementary school.

However, recently Lily came sobbing to her mom and I about the lunches she took. The kids at school had been making fun of her food, which absolutely made my heart break. I had struggled with the same thing at her age (I come from a Chinese family and would always take homemade food to school too) and when I asked her if she wanted us to report the problem, she begged us not to so she wouldn't be called a ""snitch"" or worse. When Sara heard this, she simply contacted the principal, which I didn't want to resort to at first, and left the issue, telling Lily she wouldn't be buying school lunch and to just ignore the other kids.

The same problem occured every day, Lily would be coming home feeling extremely upset and there were even times Sara would yell at Lily for not even touching her school lunch. We both had talks with Lily about her culture and how she should be proud, have contacted the schools, but the school is ignorant of the issue (they simply had a talk with the parents, and ended it there) and Lily isn't budging. I don't want her to starve, because so many days she doesn't even eat her lunch. I know how brutal middle schoolers can be, and I didn't want Lily to feel insecure or upset even if it meant making her take other lunches, but Sara refuses to make other lunches.

I began to make other lunches for Lily, like sandwiches, or sometimes mac n' cheese, so she'd feel more comfortable eating it in school in front of her classmates as a final resort when nothing else worked. I would take Lily's lunch for myself at work and pack her own lunch early in the morning, which she finished and seemed happier when coming home daily after. However, this only worked for about 2 weeks until Sara found out and was infuriated. She said I was denying Lily her culture and she needed to learn to stop being insulted by other kids, telling me I'm raising Lily to get whatever she wants. Is Sara right? AITA?

EDIT: Bringing this post and topic up tonight, I'll post an update when I can. Hopefully this is enough to convince Sara- if not, I'll do what other comments said and just keep packing Lily's lunch or let her pick.

My (15f) sister (9f) does experiments on everything. Yesterday she brought a small frog home to dissect it, which caused her room to smell horribly, and because it was open, i could smell it too. i chose to ignore that one because i wanted to give her some leeway, but earlier today she brought a larger frog home and said she’d be dissecting it in her room which made me become upset. i attempted to calm myself down and urged her to at least close her room, but she didn't want to. She explained that if she closed the door, the stench would be trapped within and would lead her to smell it more. i instructed her to stop dissecting frogs. She said that she liked it and that i could simply go outside if I didn't want it. I obviously didn't want to leave the TV show i was watching to go outside. Since her room faces the living area, i could actually smell the foul odor. She told me to quit pestering her even though i advised her to go somewhere else if she wanted to dissect the frog. I informed her that if she moved into a separate room, I wouldn't have to disturb her, but her equipment, which our mother had purchased for her, was in her room. She just ordered me to quit pestering her again after I said i’d relocate them. I exclaimed in a loud voice, ""Just get the f*ck out, you're such an ignorant little brat,"" since I was starting to grow tired of her. I'll admit that it was a touch harsh, but she simply wouldn't budge. She replied in a very calm but disrespectful tone and said “Just calm down and stop pestering me. Do you not have any pressing responsibilities? You know, the world offers very little to no validation to people like you.” I was stunned, and angry when I heard those precise words. I put on gloves, got the frog from her, and placed it in the outdoor garbage after putting it in a plastic bag. The entire time, she was glaring at me, but I didn't pay attention to her. Before my mom arrived home, I shut her room and proceeded to watch my show. When she did, she asked about my day and my sister's whereabouts. I let her know she was in her bedroom. My mother walked in and asked about her day. My sister starts telling her about how I tossed the frog she was about to dissect and how I yelled and cursed at her.

He is a 60 YO loud over the top man who yes, does yell when he talks. But he has never yelled at my daughter in anger. It’s always being sweet. “Monkey eat your lunch” “monkey it’s time to take your hiney to bed”. 

This has been the routine since the DAY she was born.

Yesterday her father, sent a serious of texts to my parents (baby grand parents) asking him not to call her monkey anymore after it’s been the norm for 14 months. because of this new tik tok video he found which says she will subconsciously think she’s a monkey when she’s older. 

My parents find it ridiculous and told him so.  I call her stinky butt is she going to think she’s a bum subconsciously? This is not a new trend… to parent by whatever tik tok video he sees that day. 

My stepfather is extremely hurt. The text messages insinuated that it wasn’t appropriate to call her anything but her name and it needed to stop.

i should also add about 3 months ago a rift formed between stepdad and baby’s father. Unrelated circumstances but my stepdad just really doesn’t like him anymore. They’re encouraging me to separate… the whole shebang.

after they got those texts a phone call argument started …. 

personally, i think it would be different if it wasn’t almost a year and a half later, and instead was the DAY he started with monkey. like a simple i don’t love that nickname do you mind changing it?

You're family is homophobic. 

I'm sorry :(",1,0,993,993,"For a little context me and my twin “Mary” are 25. We grew up close but over the years she took a different path and got lost in drugs and alcohol addiction and we just became distant. I tried to help as much as I could but  learned someone who doesn’t want help won’t accept help. My parents have always favored her and that’s another reason our relationship isn’t as strong. Over the last year I’d say we began speaking again and aren’t super close but it’s better. 

The last time we spoke was about 2 years ago when she revealed to my entire family that I was gay. It was at a dinner and she got completely trashed and said it without thinking and made more comments voicing her negative her negative opinions on the topic. My parents spoke and both cried like I ruined their lives which is another story but they’ve somewhat accepted that I won’t change. Which I can’t say about my sister. 

I have been with my fiancé F26 for about 4 years and we’re planning on getting married early spring. Although my sister has voiced her opinion on our relationship she still wanted to support and come to our wedding. Recently her and her bf M35 are both invited on the account that she is respectful. I’m not having a traditional MOH wedding party it’s more just my close friends m & f supporting me and helping but nothing too strict. My sister didn’t want to be involved so I didn’t involve her but we both agreed for her to have a speech.

We were sitting down drafting some ideas when she said is it ok if I put some jokes in it. I hesitated but said sure write them and I’ll look over them. When I read what she wrote I immediately told her no jokes: all she wrote was rude comments toward my fiancé and the majority of it was homophobic and saying shit like “it’s not a real wedding in Gods eyes so who cares”. I then told her explicitly to not comment on my relationship at all during the wedding. 

She argues that ofc she’s gonna voice her opinion bc she can’t control honesty when she’s drunk. I then say you’re not drinking then, I told her if she will not be respectful she doesn’t have to go. If she wants to go to humiliate me and my fiancé I don’t want her there. She then goes you can’t expect me to be quiet I mean you’re marrying a woman. The convo continued until I ultimately uninvited her. Now my parents are saying I’m being an AH and they won’t go either bc they aren’t going to support my actions if my sister isn’t going to be included.

I(35M) was asked by my wife(34F) about the bonus I received at work this year. When I told her about what I got, she asked me if I could loan her $10k. Since she's never asked me for this before I asked what it was for. She said it was to ""help"" her brother buy a house, and she would give him the loan and she would pay me back in monthly installments in $1k. When I asked why she wouldn't just loan him directly, she said it was because she wanted some buffer in her own finances(we have a joint account for bills but don't really mix finances). I had a bunch of questions:

Is this a gift? No, he says he will pay me back.

How would we pay this to him? She would send him the money(He lives in another country).

When is he buying the house? He's just putting a down payment on the build. It's not built yet.

When is he planning on paying you back? He'll pay it back but no idea when.

Wife is adamant that she'll pay me back, and handle it if her brother decides not to pay back. I was really concerned that her brother might not pay her back and I told her as much. My big concern is that he'll pull a ""you're married to a rich American and so I don't have to pay you back"" line on her. There's no real recourse if he doesn't and I don't think that they're really that close. Plus he lives on the other side of the planet(China). I've had a lot of questions and concerns as I've been burned loaning friends/family money in the past and my wife finally just said she wasn't going to loan him money and that she now can't rely on me for financial aid anymore(we share bills, but I pay about 75% of everything as I make more) . I've offered alternatives but wife shut it down. Now she's mad and isn't really talking to me. She says that she doesn't want to talk about it anymore. AITA here?

I think I might be because:

I can probably swing this

I might not be because:

I would visit my father for half of summer vacation and many holidays. But I really loved my life with my mom.

When I was 14, my father basically threatened to have my mother arrested if she didn't let him have custody of me.

So against my own wishes, I was forced to move back to my dad's home full time.

I hated it here and I essentially lived a separate life from my dad and his family.

When I was 16, my grandad died and had left his company to his two sons (my dad and uncle) and me. We all got a third ownership. 

My dad and uncle had more kids but my grandfather never updated the will. My family says it's because he got too old to remember. 

So here is where I think I'm the asshole. Since I was 16, I didn't know any better and my dad and uncle just ran the company themselves.

But when I turned 18, my dad and uncle talked to me about splitting the company 50/50 between them so they could split it fairly among all the grandkids instead.

I would get a cash payout of $300k for my share.

But I talked to a lawyer on my own and refused to agree. In addition, I asked for my share of the profits since the past two years and that I'd be part of the business going forward while I was going to college.

This has made life extremely difficult for my dad. My uncle is extremely resentful that only one grandchild gets a huge stake. And my dad is now paying me my share of the profits for the past two years out of his own pocket just to keep the peace.

I though that was an extremely vast amount of options, more than I normally have at home. I also had the morning free and didn't mind spending some time cooking so I was willing to make half elaborate breakfasts.
She asked me if she could have what I was eating, I was cut off guard but tried to explain in the nicest way possible that my breakfast is something I spend a little extra on myself because I really enjoy it and I can't really afford to feed everyone the same. 

She frowned and said something under her breath I don't remember now but agreed to have whatever my boyfriend wanted. Everything felt awkward for a couple hours but eventually we put it behind and enjoyed the rest of the weekend. She left yesterday and today she sent me a paragraph saying not sharing something like breakfast is greedy and it made her question if she wants to be friends with someone like that.
I wanted to apologize but my boyfriend said not to because she was acting entitled. AITA?

Edit: I wasn't planning on eating in front of her I just woke up early and thought she wouldn't wake up for at least an hour. I now know however I should have just not eaten that the same day. I understand and will apologize to her. However, I feel like people insulting me don't understand at all what being poor and having one thing to enjoy for yourself is. I try to share everything, I just have this one thing I really like and I spend a good portion of my income in.

Tell her to give you a heads up when she has company coming over so you can dress accordingly (if you want to), other than that, you are not going to hide who you are for anyone.",197,0,3467,3467,"I (21f) have been a stripper for about a year now. I’m open about it with people, my family knows what I do, I’m not ashamed of it at all. I was on the verge of being homeless when I started and now just recently I was able to pay my rent for a year.

I have 2 roommates. They know what I do, asked some questions about it in the beginning but they’re very accepting. People in our age group don’t tend to care.

The issue:

I was in the kitchen making myself some dinner when my roommate(also 21f) walked in with her boyfriend. He’s coming to visit for a few days. They started making themselves some food as well so we exchanged some small talk. He asked what I’m studying in school and I told him that I’m taking a break from school for a few months and pretty much just focusing on work. He asked what I do for work and I told him I’m a stripper. He was pretty much like “oh cool” and we moved on.

I finished up and went back into my room to eat. Didn’t think anything of it but I got a text from my roommate later that night. She said she “really didn’t appreciate me telling her bf that I’m a stripper especially dressed the way I was.” 

I was confused bc I was wearing shorts and a tank top which is what I literally always wear around the house and I also didn’t know her bf was coming so it’s not like I was planning it out. I told her that I’m sorry she was uncomfortable but i tell anyone who asks what I do because I’m not ashamed of it and I was just wearing what I normally do.

She said that “I should know better than anyone what a male mind is going to imagine when they see a woman wearing revealing clothes who then says she gets naked for money.” Then said that I’m used to seeking out male attention.

I truly didn’t know how to respond and still don’t, the conversation made me pretty uncomfortable and I’ve pretty much just tried to stay in my room the past few days. I am aware that the nature of my job is sexual and I know that some men will “fetishize” me for lack of a better word. So I do understand why she’d be upset about it I just don’t think I did anything directly wrong?

Edit: Yes I could afford to move out if I wanted to but I live in an expensive city and figured why bother because I could save more and have never had an issue with my roommates before. We all renewed our leases last month

Edit 2: I live in a major city where stripping is popular and regulated. That’s how I make so much.",3467,"DontAskMeChit","CalmMaka",0
"AITA for suggesting my stepson (16M) moves out?","YTA. You didn't handle this tactfully at all and for that you're going to get a lot of 'wicked stepmother' jibes. I understand that objectively this may make the most logical sense; the household is less congested and both boys get their privacy, but there are so many other factors to consider. What's his relationship like with his Mother? What's that household like? Would she want/be able to have him live there full time? Even if these answers are all positive he may like having both homes/families involved equally and rightfully see removing one as a big step he's not ready for.  

Also, poor form for going rogue and not discussing it with his Dad first. And implying that he's somehow responsible for putting the notion in your head cause his other kids have already done it is absurd. 

Bit of a shit show all round really. I suggest you apologise profusely.",20,0,2864,2864,"My husband and I have 6 children total and live in 4 bedroom house. We have two sons together (8 & 6), I have a son from a previous relationship (15), and I have 3 step children (20F, 16M & 16F). We live in a 4 bedroom house and for most the time we lived there we had 2 kids per room with the youngest boys sharing, the older boys sharing and the girls sharing. 

Things changed a couple years ago. My oldest stepdaughter finished school and is attending university locally. The girls decided at this point that instead of sharing a bedroom at their dads and sharing a bedroom at their mums, they would each take 1 room as their permanent bedroom. So the 16 yr old lives with us full time and the 20 yr old lives with her mum full time. They both visit the other parents house regularly. 

My 16 yr old stepson has his own bedroom at his mum's house but still splits time between each parents house mostly 50/50. My son lives full time with us as he doesn't have much of a relationship with his dad. My son and stepson do not get on that well and they can often be heard screaming at each other in their bedroom. 

Recently, I asked my stepson why he doesn't move to live full time with his mum so he and my son can have a similar arrangement as their sisters. This way both of the boys would have their own rooms. He would obviously still visit like his older sister does and we could figure something out like a futon instead of a bed in their room so my son has more space when stepson's not there. 

My stepson overreacted to my suggestion and is trying to make out like I'm kicking him out, when really I'm just thinking of a better use of space. It's unfair that all the older kids but my son have their own rooms at one of their parents house. My son likes the idea and has brought it up to his stepbrother a few more times since I originally suggested it and it has caused arguments between them. He now seems to be considering it. 

My husband is angry with me for suggesting his son moving permanently to his mums. He thinks that he and his son would have a less close relationship if this happens (my husband favours his oldest son over our boys). He also thinks I'm making his son feel like he's being forced out. However, it was his daughters already doing the same thing that gave me the idea because it worked out well for them and they both seem happier. I'm also not forcing this to happen I was just suggesting it to him, it would be completely up to him. Is this a good plan or AITA for bringing it up?",2864,"Full-String7137","brgtail1735",0

Caden is very obsessed with seeming masculine, and he takes a lot of pride in his personal style. He has a decent following on YouTube  and TikTok, and his “brand” is basically about being a player and attracting girls.

Well, he was making a video yesterday with some fairly expensive jeans he copped from a local custom designer. They are light pink and he was having trouble finding a shirt to match. He came out to the kitchen complaining, and I told him to wear this tee I got for his birthday last month. I told him the pattern had some pink in it and would match well with pink jeans.

Caden immediately started yelling and kicking off. He insisted that they weren’t pink, and accused me of gaslighting him. He said they were red and I just had an agenda of masculating him. These jeans are literally rose pink, so I was definitely not gaslighting him.

He called our mom at work (this was during her lunch hour) and told her what I said. My mom took Caden’s side and accused me of raining on my brothers parade by making him feel bad about his new clothes. I replied that I don’t think guys wearing pink is bad, and Caden is just making drama over nothing.

Now Caden won’t wear the jeans, and because they aren’t returnable, my mom wants me to reimburse him the cost of the jeans. There’s no way I’m doing that.

So the 16 yr old lives with us full time and the 20 yr old lives with her mum full time. They both visit the other parents house regularly. 

My 16 yr old stepson has his own bedroom at his mum's house but still splits time between each parents house mostly 50/50. My son lives full time with us as he doesn't have much of a relationship with his dad. My son and stepson do not get on that well and they can often be heard screaming at each other in their bedroom. 

Recently, I asked my stepson why he doesn't move to live full time with his mum so he and my son can have a similar arrangement as their sisters. This way both of the boys would have their own rooms. He would obviously still visit like his older sister does and we could figure something out like a futon instead of a bed in their room so my son has more space when stepson's not there. 

My stepson overreacted to my suggestion and is trying to make out like I'm kicking him out, when really I'm just thinking of a better use of space. It's unfair that all the older kids but my son have their own rooms at one of their parents house. My son likes the idea and has brought it up to his stepbrother a few more times since I originally suggested it and it has caused arguments between them. He now seems to be considering it. 

My husband is angry with me for suggesting his son moving permanently to his mums. He thinks that he and his son would have a less close relationship if this happens (my husband favours his oldest son over our boys). He also thinks I'm making his son feel like he's being forced out. However, it was his daughters already doing the same thing that gave me the idea because it worked out well for them and they both seem happier. I'm also not forcing this to happen I was just suggesting it to him, it would be completely up to him. Is this a good plan or AITA for bringing it up?",2864,"ApprehensiveIce9026","brgtail1735",0
"AITA for telling my brother not to be cruel to his future stepdaughters?","Ella is the expected babysitter by the sound of it, well brother and gf are in for a sharp shock arnt they if they won't listen",12,0,107,107,"My brother is engaged to Maddy. My brother has my niece Ella (17f) and Maddy has two girls Naomi (6) and Niamh (7). Naomi and Niamh have had a pretty rough early life. Their bio father walked out when they were babies, their bio father's family didn't want to know them and Maddy's family didn't want to know her or the girls because they never approved of the girls' bio father and wanted nothing to do with the family. They have been homeless in the past and one of the girls has stomach issues so there's been a lot going on.

Just like them Ella's had her struggles. Her mom died when she was 9 and she and my brother were never super close, he wasn't the best dad to her, and she's detached from him. In the last year or so she's been clear that she won't hang around him once she's 18. I already told her she can always live with me if she ever needs/wants to. She and I are close despite her and my brother not being close. I think because even though I'm her dad's sister, I knew her mom well and talk about her mom with her. My brother has heard her say she's moving out on her 18th birthday and won't stick around. He's heard her say he's not her family.

Yet he and Maddy have hyped Naomi and Niamh up to expect Ella as their big sister. The girls wanted to go to the wedding with Ella, want to sit with Ella, want to go dress shopping with her. They even talk about after the wedding and how she'll be their sister. My brother and Maddy not only encourage this but have told them Ella will do this stuff and how it'll be great when they're all officially sisters. They have also promised the three of them will be kept together during the wedding and these little girls are so excited.

I find it so cruel to the little girls because Ella does not give a crap about them. She's been one foot out the door for more than a year and those girls change nothing. I'm not even sure she's spent any real time with them and she couldn't tell you the first thing about either of them. She also has no idea what her dad has promised them.

I tried to talk to Maddy and she didn't seem to have any issue with the idea her girls would end up hurt. She believes Ella will be madly in love with them by the wedding and even if she doesn't talk to her dad, will be the sister they need. My brother shrugged when I brought it up to him. He told me blended families all have bumps in the road. I told him not to be cruel to those little girls when he knows Ella won't be around in seven more months and that he is letting two small children who have lost so much, been rejected so much, get their hopes up for a sister he knows won't be sticking around. My words were not received well (not hugely surprised but you know) and he told me I was being an asshole calling him cruel when he's doing good by Naomi and Niamh.

"AITA for reporting my classmates for joking that I have pretty privilege?","They fucked around and found out. NTA",7,0,29168,29168,"Background: I'm (F23) one of only a few female students in a male-dominated course. Furthermore, I am at a highly prestigious university and I haven't really gotten along with the guys on my course. They are all very competitive and I just don't really enjoy their company - everything turns into a pissing contest, and they definitely take me less seriously because I'm a woman. I stopped interacting with them beyond the mere minimum and choose to hang out with other people. 

Anyway:

I did well in our recent exams (I topped two out of four exams we had so far). Our prof congratulated me during class (I wouldn't have advertised this myself). Ever since then, my interactions with a specific group of male classmates have gotten weird. They're now outright rude and challenge me aggressively in class discussions. We recently had some presentations and one of them chose to do theirs on, to put it simply, ""pretty privilege"" - they specifically pointed to two papers that suggested that pretty female students get overscored in assessments. The other guys in the group snickered and one even gave me a wink. Afterwards, I heard them in the hallway joking that ""they had experience with that themselves"".

I've been seeing a PhD student within our department for a month. He has literally nothing to do with our course. Well, we ran into one of my course mates A together. The next day in class his friend B asked me if ""my boyfriend"" helped me with exams. He said this intentionally loudly and in front of the professor, who heard this. I replied that I don't have a boyfriend (cause he's not my bf), but then B pointed out that he had run into me with the PhD student, making a point to say his name (the prof knows him). I just replied that we're only friends.

They didn't let up - I heard that they discussed this thing in two more classes, in earshot of the professors. Both times they suggested I got help for my exams ( I wasn't even seeing him then). I didn’t confront them, but this has been causing me so much anxiety - even without the exam accusations, I worked hard to get here and I don’t want to be known among the faculty for my dating life.

I raised this issue with my supervisor, without the intention of taking it any further, but I wanted her advice as a woman in academia. She convinced me to let her email their supervisors ""to remind them of proper conduct"" and described their treatment of an ""unnamed female student"". She didn't name me, but they figured it out. They confronted me after class and asked my why I would report their “silly joke“. Apparently, their supervisors are now very cold towards them and less interested in helping. It’s not a formal complaint - only their supervisors know - but one of them, C, said his supervisor writes the reports for his financial aid/scholarship and it was my fault if he lost out on that.

I now feel a bit embarrassed and this was compounded by a friend telling me I took it to far cause C shouldn't lose out on his scholarship. So, reddit - AITA?

I'm studying computer science and I'm currently doing an internship at a medium-sized company that hasn't laid off 30% of its employees (yet).

So, since I'm the one who knows about computers, my family sees me as their personal tech support. And my family is B.I.G. I live with my mom, my little brother, 2 of my aunts and their kids. The kids are lazy when it comes to tech shit because they know I'll do it for them, but my mom and aunts are beyond tech illiterate, they're tech morons.

I am constantly interrupted in my studies or word because my cousins forgot their Disney Plus profile pin, or my mom needs to reset her email password again, I actually set up a cloud password manager for them that they do not use because they always forget that it is an option. 

So a few weeks ago, one of my little cousins wanted me to help him reset a password after he got locked out of Google, and he aggressively knocked on my door demanding that I help him.  I asked him, ""Do I look like TS to you?"" and he said yes with a straight face.

So I got a domain and set up a help desk. Then I told my family that if they wanted any help from me, they should go to the website and submit a ticket for my help. My aunt said I was being ridiculous, but I was deadly serious.

In the following days, I would give them the cold shoulder if they tried to come to me with technical problems, and just tell them to submit a ticket and I would send them the solution by mail. Forgot your mail password? Too bad, use someone else's mail. Fortnite is lagging? Get a ticket and wait till I'm home. That helped me a lot.

But then yesterday I came back from the university and the whole house was sitting in the living room telling me to sit down. They were doing an INTERVENTION on me! WTF!? They said I was rude, cold, condescending, and unhelpful. My mom said she's tolerated my ""manly ways"" (no idea where that comes from) because I'm helpful with technology, but now they won't stand up to my disrespect and I'm treating them like children. I said no, I'm treating them like customers.

The discussion got heated and turned into a screaming match.

"AITA for talking to my trans friend instead of listening to them?","NAH. This is a tough subject, and what you're saying is not assholic, nor will I fault someone who is questioning or trans for being very stressed about the situation.

BTW Good organizations put a lot of effort into DEI specifically to make it easier to bring your whole self to work (I know this sounds like smoke being blown up your ass, but hiding who you are at work definitely decreases your performance, and is no way to live). Also the reason why there are places to put pronouns on Slack, etc., isn't so much the wokeness it seems either (even if it technically is mostly virtue signalling). It's letting you know that work *is* a safe space. It also gives trans folks air cover to put their pronouns there without it being a glowing neon sign pointing at them. It also puts the onus on the person you're conversing with to try to use your preferred pronouns.",8,0,7,7,"My friend Nick (fake name) came to the conclusion he was trans last year and he went to all of our friends in order to get resources and opinions on how he should move forward with this discovery. Me and a majority of all of our friends told him to do his research and look for trans spaces where he could gain insight from people who were actually trans (unlike myself) so he could be better informed. As a cis man there's a lot about the trans experience I will simply never fully understand but will just have to try my best to empathize with. 

The other night me, Nick, and a third friend are in the voice chat just hanging out and he starts talking about a group therapy session he had that day and how he believes that the notion of introducing yourself by stating your preferred pronouns isn't necessarily a good way to present yourself to people. His reasoning being that closeted trans people might not be in a good place to present their preferred pronouns. He went on to theorize that a better way of doing this would to be talking to individual members in any safe space (therapy, an LGBT+ event, work, etc) one at a time instead.

Its an interesting idea but I brought up how it probably wouldn't work in a corporate setting, since corporations prefer to know an individual's pronouns outright so they can avoid being potentially liable for an employee discriminating against someone based on their identity early on. He pushed back against this saying that he didn't think a real trans person would willingly out themselves at work and that a corporation wouldn't be interested in an employees preferred gender at all. Then I told him he was wrong based on sexual harassment training I've undergone at different work environments that have sections specifically stating gender-based discrimination. But ultimately I agreed (and still agree honestly) that an individualized approach to how a person wants to referred to as would be the best way to go about introductions.

But Nick go mad at me saying ""Why are we even talking about this right now?"" and I told him ""Because you brought up introductions in group settings, like a corporate work environment."" After walking back through the conversation with him he tells me ""Let's just drop it I don't want to talk about this anymore."" Sensing that he was upset I tried telling him ""I feel like you think I'm fighting against you on this when I'm not."" And that's when the third friend was just like ""Justified stop disagreeing with him!"" when I really wasn't trying to.

I know Nick's sensitive when it comes to discussing gender at all and I get the feeling he doesn't like it when I pipe up about it at all due to me being cis, but making him upset really bothered me to the point of physical discomfort.

I work from the office two days a week, my husband (44M) is remote 100% of the time. His job is pretty slack and he sleeps in after our daughter goes to school at 7:30 until 10:00-12:00.

I was getting ready this morning and realized my shirt was wrinkly. I asked my husband if he could please iron my shirt for me (it would probably take 5-10 minutes for him to do it). I made a joke about ""Hey, do you want to do a house husband task?"" because he's always joking about being a stay at home husband/dad once I get a big promotion (I am very career oriented, he hates his line of work and would love to quit).

He said no like ""OMG why would I do that, I work too"" and walked away. I honestly really can't iron very well and was rushed, so I tried to steam the shirt. The steamer spit rust on my white shirt. I was panicked and asked him to get me a wet wash cloth to try to salvage the shirt and it didn't work. 

I put on a different shirt that didn't quite match. He's like ""Look, it's fine!"" I said ""If it were you and you needed help, I would have ironed your shirt."" He immediately got defensive and did the ""I'm the victim and you're the villain"" thing. 

""You're mad at me because I didn't iron your shirt?"" Like, no, I'm hurt because I would be supportive of you in an instance that you were not supportive of me. He doesn't even know what my presentation is about or how important it is (he has made an effort to be encouraging and go ""It'll be great, you'll do great""). He asserts it's unfair and manipulative that I'm upset at all.

He pointed out ""all the other stuff"" he does for me (begrudgingly or resentfully) like turning on my car 10 minutes before I leave for work when I ask because it's freezing (because his two cars and two motorcycles take up the whole garage) and getting me a wash cloth when I asked.

I feel like he's TA because it would have taken 5-10 minutes for him to make me feel really supported and I would and HAVE been that supportive of him our entire relationship. He thinks I'm TA because I should have ironed my own shirt last night, it's unreasonable to have expected him to help at the last minute,  and I had no right to be upset with him.

A little over three years ago my sister had an accident in a sport which landed her in a coma. 

Layla’s horse is boarded about a 4 hour drive from where I (and most of my family) live. My older brother (Jacob, 29M) and his mom live less than an hour away from the stable. The horse is fully trained and Layla used to compete with him. The arrangement has always been that most of the horse’s expenses would be paid for by Jacob’s mom (our dad isn’t in the picture for any of us) as well as my mom and stepdad. After Layla’s accident, Jacob started contributing financially to the horse’s needs and even started riding him. 


Last week my parents asked me if we could “have a talk”. When I got to my parents’ house, My best friend and Layla’s longterm boyfriend (Thomas, 21M) was also there and didn’t know why he was called over either. 

My parents pretty bluntly told the both of us that they were going to sell Layla’s horse because it’s unlikely that she’ll ever wake up again and it’s not reasonable to keep putting money into the animal. 

I asked if they’d spoken to Jacob or his mom about this, since they’re the horse’s primary caretakers and put a fair amount of money in as well. My parents said they hadn’t spoken to Jacob or his mom, and they shouldn’t have to because it’s Layla’s horse and they’re her parents. 

Thomas disagreed with this, and offered to contribute financially to the horse, as well as driving up to take care of him. If and when Layla does wake up, she’s going to want to know her horse is okay. I agreed with Thomas, and put out the same offer. 

My parents told the both of us that we’re not thinking clearly and it’s better for everyone if the horse is just sold. This decision didn’t sit right with me so I called Jacob and asked what he thought about the matter. Jacob wants to keep the horse and so does his mother, and his mom has said that she will fully pay for the horse’s expenses by herself if it comes to it. My parents told Jacob that he just needs to get over it because it’s not his choice, and hung up on him. 

Once the call had ended, my parents said that I was completely wrong for calling Jacob for his opinion, and that they’re disappointed in both Thomas and I for even considering keeping the horse. Both my parents are upset now, they won’t answer my calls and have also seemed to cut contact with Thomas who was like a son to them. 

AITA for going against my parents on wanting to sell my sister’s horse and asking my brother his opinion on it?

The horse had nothing to do with Layla’s accident, she was athletic and involved in multiple sports at the time. 

As far as I know, my parents are completely fine with money, though it is possible that they’re just not telling me.

I’m not 100% sure as to who has the legal rights to the horse because we’ve always called him Layla’s and never really talked further about it, but I assume he belongs to my parents. 

Thomas and I are both in ongoing therapy, therapy was suggested to my mom a lot back when the accident first happened but I don’t think she ever went, and my stepdad refuses to go.

Both myself and Thomas still regularly go see Layla and spend hours if not the full day with her, the main reason for keeping so much hope is that occasionally there’ll be the slightest movements, yet obviously non-responsive or her heart rate will slightly pick up. My parents don’t go see her very often anymore, but they still ask both of us about how she is. 

Idk if it’s relevant but Layla and I are twins, and she had been dating Thomas since she was 13 and he was 14, which explains the extra attachment.

Other people do interact with the horse, he’s properly groomed and those of Layla’s friends who also boarded their horse there, as well as sometimes the owners of the stable will pet him and take him out into the paddock when they bring their own horses out and bring him in again. 

Layla has been in the coma for three years.

The horse is currently 17. The last time we got an offer on him was while Layla was dismounting after a competition. Back then, those offers were almost $44,000. Layla was the one to refuse that offer directly. That was about 6 months before the accident.

"AITA for not using the regular public restroom?","NTA. I wouldn't have engaged on any level, you owe no one an explanation. If you were in there injecting insulin, you wouldn't have owed her an explanation what you were doing. If her toddler had a blow out and she had to clean them up, it would probably take a while to get them presentable again, too. Sometimes people take longer in the damn bathroom. You don't harass them into telling you why.",16,0,192,192,"First, allow me to set the scene: I was out at Dave & Busters in my local mall (for those who don't know what that is, it's an arcade/restaurant partially aimed at adults but obviously families bring kids too). It was a Monday evening and not particularly crowded, though there were a handful of families with small children there. 

Now, let me give some relevant context: When I was younger, I had a traumatic event happen to me in a public restroom which has resulted in me having anxiety surrounding the use of public bathrooms. it's not *impossible* for me to use them, but it's difficult (I have to very mindfully calm my panic response) and it ends up taking longer than typical to do my business, even just #1.. (sorry if that's TMI, I just want to be thorough in explaining the context)

Ok, now that we have that out of the way...
So I'm at D&B with a friend and have to go to the bathroom. I know they have one of those 'family' restrooms that is just a large single room/stall where you can lock the door and not worry about anyone else being in there, so I try the door and no one is using it so I go ahead and lock the door behind me and just as I sit on the toilet, the door handle jiggles. damn. ""occupied!"", I call out & just hear a muffled grunt in response. This, unfortunately, does kick in a bit of an anxiety response, but I calm myself & do what I gotta do - all in all, I was in the bathroom for just under 7 minutes (i noticed the time when I sat down and looked again after washing my hands)

When I come out, there's a woman waiting with her toddler who, upon seeing me exit alone, starts going off on me and telling me I have no business using a family restroom, especially in an establishment where there's clearly always going to be families around who may need it.

I just apologized and said that it was available and there weren't very many families in the facility at the time anyway and explained that I had a good enough reason for using it myself. She scoffed at this and asked what excuse could *possibly* have for taking away a facility (albeit briefly) from the families it was created for in the first place.

I don't really feel that my trauma is anyone's business so I told her, as calmly as I could muster, that my reasons are none of her business and either way, it's available now, so go ahead and use it. And then I walked away. I was feeling a little shook up and when I mentioned it to my friend, he agreed that I was kinda the AH cuz I could have just gone out into the mall area and probably found a family restroom to use out there.. (there were maybe 20, at most, people milling about the rest of the mall area)

1, the fact that this party was held at my friends house, it's not like this was at an event space or something where this would be normal imo. 2, there was no bar tender that they hired or anything like that. It was literally 2 of the 4 of them standing in the kitchen at a time making drinks for people and then charging them accordingly (drinks were all under $10).

Now idk if this is actually a common thing, but I have never in my 42 years of living been to a ""party"" at a friends house where the hosts are charging you themselves for drinks.

I've had multiple parties over the years, that I have invited my friend and his gf to in which they have attended, and I've never charged **ANYONE** for drinks ever. I've always bought all the drinks myself and had an open bar type of situation. Where my guests can make there own drinks. I even had a proper bar tender once and still no one was charged, it was an open bar.

I honestly felt like my friend, his gf and their friends were all trying to make a quick buck off of their guests who attended. Clearly to cover to cost of the drinks. Which yeah I understand that booze isn't cheap these days but we're talking splitting the cost of whatever they bought between **4 PEOPLE**. Like in my opinion if you can't afford to supply drinks at your party, why are you having a party in the first place?

This also wasn't for charity or anything the money made off of the drinks was for them to split.

My wife and I bought one drink each, stayed for about an hour or so, and said our goodbyes. When we were leaving my friend asked why we didn't have that much to drink? I told him because I think it's ridiculous that they are charging their close friends for drinks. He called me cheap and an unsupportive friend. I assured him that i'm not, if the charging of drinks was for a good cause (like profits go to charity or something) of course i'd buy drinks.

I told him I find the fact that they are charging for drinks, and keeping the money for themselves ridiculous and taking advantage of their friends. Anyway now my friend and his gf are butt hurt about this and have been calling me an AH to our mutual friends. AITA here?

(EDIT: Wow! I did not expect this post to blow up like this but thank you guys.

For any of those wondering, after reading these comments my wife and I have decided to exclude my ""friend"" and his gf from any of our future parties. I blocked both my ""friend"" and his gf as well.)",6647,"Eris-Ares","cheapfriends-ta",0

"AITA for not sharing my “toys” with my best friend’s daughter?","NTA. Riley needs to learn how to share.",1,0,6923,6923,"So my (31F) best friend “Riley” (31F) recently just got a part-time job after several years of staying home with her daughter “Ella” (6F). She and her husband “Joe” (34M) haven’t been able to get the childcare situation totally sorted out and needed a babysitter last Saturday, so I agreed to watch Ella for the day while Riley was at work. 

I've been sort of the ""cool aunt"" ever since Ella was born. I typically will bring small gifts or activities whenever I know that I will be seeing her, which isn't all that often. Ella is a smart and engaged kid and I like to give her things that will interest her and keep her occupied.

One important piece of information here is that I'm a very crafty person. I have a small online store and also work with local businesses for selling and distributing small batches of my product - hand painted wooden figurines. I thought it might be fun to introduce Ella into my hobby/business, so I ended up bringing 10 unpainted figurines to choose from, a few tubes of acrylic paint, and some paint brushes. 

We immediately got to work and Ella was *so* into it. She had an absolute blast painting her turtle figurine. But when it came time for me to leave, I started packing up all of my supplies and Ella became visibly upset. Riley insisted that I leave the supplies behind so that Ella could keep and play with them. I disagreed, and basically said that I have no obligation to give away any of my belongings. 

I personally feel like I was more than generous by babysitting Ella on my day off (I do have a regular 9-5 job as well) and providing a fun activity for her. Riley pointed out that I have a pretty large stock of items at home, which is true, but still - letting Ella keep the supplies and figurines would've been a loss in profit for my business. Ella cried when I didn't let her keep any of the stuff and Riley argued that I should have never brought “toys” over if I wasn't willing to let Ella keep them. 

Now Riley hasn't been responding to any of my messages or calls and I can only assume she's still angry over this whole thing. I thought I was doing something nice by babysitting and providing a fun activity. 

AITA for not letting Ella keep my crafting supplies?

HE NEVER ASKED IF YOU WERE READY AND ONLY CARED YOU UPSET HIS MOMMY",22,0,1135,1135,"Me (19F) and my soon-to-be husband (21M) got engaged after 4 years together.

I was really young when we first started dating and the nagging of my MIL, wanting us to have kids early, always bothered me. I took my complaints to my fiancé but he dismissed me saying that i should ""understand his mother's ways"". I didn't get her hopes up about me having kids, because i always said that i wanted to mature enough to be able to raise a kid.

As i said, i just dismissed her nagging, until last week.

My fiancé came home from work (that btw he works with his mother), saying: ""I was with mom all that in the office,and after she told me some things i came to the conclusion that you should stop taking your birth control pills"". Unbelievable. Didn't even want to argue about something this ridiculous.

Time passed and we didn't touch this issue anymore.

The weekend came, and we went to visit my MIL's house, she took me to her room saying she needed to have a word with me and my fiancé.

She sat down on the bed and said: ""I had a discussion with Luiz (my fiancé's name), and i told him about my concern with you guys not having children at the appropriate age. Who knows if you're going to be able to have children with this disease of yours? As for now, he will no longer allow you to buy the birth control pills per my request""

(He never buyed them for me, i work 9 hours a day and everything i buy for myself comes from my money)

About ""my disease"": It's a disease that all the women in my father's side had: Uterus Cancer. My great-great-grandmother passed due to it, my great-grandmother too and my grandma had it after giving birth to my father, but the doctors took the uterus out before the cancer could spread further. My grandma was always cautious with me. Never had any issues, and i go to the gynecologist 2 times a year to do exams.

 I got enraged, and looked at my fiancé who was sitting beside her, and he just averted his eyes.

""you will regret leaving the thoughts of having kids after your graduation, because god time is now and i got a revelation from the pastor that one of my family members is going to try to have kids and it's not gonna be able to. I'm sure that person is you, and i'm worried for my son. I can't leave this marriage be if your thoughts don't align.""

When she said that last line, i exploded, saying ""Are you so desperate for me to sit on your son's cock and have a baby so what? It's not your business if we're having kids or not or if we're having sex or not, this must be a joke"".

The argument escalated but i don't remember much because i got so enraged that i started trembling and had to go home to calm myself down alone, as i left my fiancé there.

When he came home, he was pissed off saying that i disrespected his mother and that if i didn't apologise he would consider breaking off the engagement. Honestly am not making any effort to set things straight as i'm very offended by everything she said.

Lily is a bully. I have met her a handful of times and she is always making fun of Eni, who is a little fat, Lily's always telling that bad pig jokes and she even gave Eni a nickname, Pigni.
I have complained to Tom and Tom's mom that Lily's jokes weren't funny and she should stop, but they always said she was just joking. I told Eni that she should return the jokes to Lily, but she can never think of anything to say.
Last year I was invited to Tom's family's Christmas party, everything was fine until Lily said something like ""Oh God Eni, you've already eaten so much, at this pace you'll stop being Pigni to become Whalni"" and she laugh with the children at the party. I was furious and Eni and Tom gave a fake laugh and said that Eni was 4 months pregnant. When we were all congratulating them, Lily said ""wow, at least now you can excuse yourself when people see you eating like a pig."" I got furious again but Eni asked me to just let it go but I know how much that jokes hurt her. So I went back to having a talk with Tom and his mother about why Lily's teasing had to stop.
 Well, this weekend was Eni's babyshower, we were having a good time until Lily told another joke about how ""fat"" Eni had gotten, I had enough so I laughed so loud to attract attention and said ""Oh Lily, you're so funny, especially when you finish your jokes with that ugly pig laugh, sometimes I think people laugh more at your laugh than at your joke."" Lily got super serious and she told me it wasn't funny, to which I said ""come on, it's a joke"" and imitated her laugh, the kids at the party laughed too and Lily ran away while she cried. Tom's mother scolded me for the joke and I asked her why Lily's jokes were funny but mine weren't, if they both had a pig joke in it, and her mother couldn't answer me. I told her that every time I heard Lily tell a joke about Eni, I would return the joke. Eni told me that I shouldn't have done that, but I could see her hold back her laughter along with the other guests, but I'm tired of Eni being walked over.

Some days ago, we were on her house, watching a serie, just chilling on her living room. We were having a good time together, and we started kissing (not making out, just little kisses), when his brother (17M) entered the room, saw us and screamed: ""QUE HACES BESANDO A LA LISIADA!!!"" and started to laugth. (Context, that quote is from a scene of an old mexican tv novel, the dialog was so unreal and the acting so exagerated that it became a meme. In english it would be translate as ""What are you doing kissing the cripple?""). 

My girlfriend didnt said anything, but by her face I could notice that hurted and ashamed her, and hearing him laugthing of it made me angry. 

I got up and demanded him to apologize. He said that it wasnt a big deal, that all them do those kind of jokes all the time. I didnt care and still demanded him to apologize. 

Her father came in due to the noise, and he laugth a little for the ""joke"", but told his son to dont do it again. He kept saying it was a joke and I just were exagerating, and I told him that he was one of the biggest pendejos I ever saw in my life.

My parents are very doting grandparents to my 3 bio kids but have always been standoffish with my stepsons. There has been lots of little things over the years that have shown how little they care for them. They have never once bought them a birthday present (my wife's parents get my daughter's gifts) and at Christmas they are always given the most pathetic/cheap gift. It's not always bad as there has been times when, my dad in particular, has been good at engaging with them. In November he came with me and the boys to watch a football game and go out for lunch and everybody had a great time.

Last week my mom stayed with us as it was my daughter's 10th birthday. She stayed in the 17 year olds room and he slept on an air mattress in his brother's room. Not only did she never think to thank him, but she also tried banning him from going in the room at all when he occasionally needed to. One morning he knocked on the door to ask if he could go in to grab his sneakers and she said no and wouldn't even pass them to him. I had to intervene and get them myself. Despite this he was nothing but polite to her face. If I listed every passive aggressive thing she said/did to the boys during her stay it would make this post to long.

On Friday, the 13 yo and toddler were playing outside with a basketball. At one point 13 yo threw the ball a little too hard at his brother and knocked him over. My mom had been outside and saw what happened and started to berate the 13 yo and grabbing him hard by the arm. When his mom came outside to see why the baby was crying my mom continued to say foul things about my stepson and called him an awful brother and dangerous to her grandson. When stepson told his mom what he had accidentally done, my mom started raving about him doing it on purpose.

When I got home my stepson was sulking in his room. My wife had told me what had happened, so I went to see him, and we talked. He vented about how my mom had made him feel the whole week and asked me why she hated him and his brother. This made me angry and after talking with my wife, I decided to ask my mom to leave and told her she wouldn’t be welcome back until she corrected her attitude towards my stepsons. Of course, she didn’t take this well and after she argued with me for over an hour she left. Later I got a call from my dad who was livid, he wouldn’t let me explain myself, so I hang up.

I feel I did the right thing to protect my stepsons, but my siblings are also upset with me. They think I’m an ass for treating our mom badly and overreacting.

Before the day was done however, I was pulled aside by a manager that said that she was simply concerned. She told me that she wanted to make sure that I was using neutral wording and siting my references because I wouldn't want to make people uncomfortable in the workplace. 

I left that day feeling a little discouraged and overwhelmed with the new hoops I'd have to jump through if I still wanted to go through with this. Nevertheless I strapped my boots on, used my own printer and paper from home and got to work. The next day the same manager comes up to me with a list she made to ""help"" me. She wanted to make sure I showed the ""positive"" side of black history. I explained to her that I felt underrepresented in the company and that bringing this knowledge can spark conversations and hopefully bring people together. 

Her response to this was ""let me know if im crossing a line but I feel like God puts a hole in every person that can only be filled with him. So when you catch myself looking for outside representation, you should look to God instead."" With that comment, I thanked her for her list and she skipped away. Her list had Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan and Jackie Robinson on it as well as some other athletes. I did not go with her list, I went with people that made me feel good and facts based locally to more relate to people. For example,  one was about William Taylor's barbershop in St. Paul and how it used to be a stop on the underground railroad. 

My efforts were definitely not appreciated by my manager and even though black history month is over and the dust is now settled.

I(35M) was asked by my wife(34F) about the bonus I received at work this year. When I told her about what I got, she asked me if I could loan her $10k. Since she's never asked me for this before I asked what it was for. She said it was to ""help"" her brother buy a house, and she would give him the loan and she would pay me back in monthly installments in $1k. When I asked why she wouldn't just loan him directly, she said it was because she wanted some buffer in her own finances(we have a joint account for bills but don't really mix finances). I had a bunch of questions:

Is this a gift? No, he says he will pay me back.

How would we pay this to him? She would send him the money(He lives in another country).

When is he buying the house? He's just putting a down payment on the build. It's not built yet.

When is he planning on paying you back? He'll pay it back but no idea when.

Wife is adamant that she'll pay me back, and handle it if her brother decides not to pay back. I was really concerned that her brother might not pay her back and I told her as much. My big concern is that he'll pull a ""you're married to a rich American and so I don't have to pay you back"" line on her. There's no real recourse if he doesn't and I don't think that they're really that close. Plus he lives on the other side of the planet(China). I've had a lot of questions and concerns as I've been burned loaning friends/family money in the past and my wife finally just said she wasn't going to loan him money and that she now can't rely on me for financial aid anymore(we share bills, but I pay about 75% of everything as I make more) . I've offered alternatives but wife shut it down. Now she's mad and isn't really talking to me. She says that she doesn't want to talk about it anymore. AITA here?

I think I might be because:

I can probably swing this

I might not be because:

This is a train wreck waiting to happen.",1,0,1883,1883,"I (25F) have been married to my husband (29F) for a few years now. He has a younger brother who recently got engaged. I have known his brother’s girlfriend for 4 years. We’re not extremely close but we hang out whenever there’s a family get together.

Anyways, for her bridal party she’s asked me to be the Maid of Honour. She has four other bridesmaids composed of cousins and old school friends. I told her that I’m very grateful that she has asked me but unfortunately I don’t have the time to do all the things expected of a MOH. I just had my first baby in November and it’s a lot. She has expressed wanting a bridal shower, bachelorette party, etc.

I told her I can just be a regular bridesmaid. She seemed fine but afterwards, my husband told me that she was venting to my brother and telling him that I’m being cold to her. According to her, she thinks I’m lying by saying I’m too busy because I’m on maternity leave and that I have “all the time in the world” and all her other friends work full time. 

My husband agrees with me but his brother called me said I should try to “be accommodating to her”. I reconsidered and told her I would be her MOH if she covers half of the responsibilities, eg planning the bachelorette party. He said he would get back to me.

The next day, she calls me and asks me why I’m being so difficult. She says I’m the only one in the bridal party not working and that I should step up. I told her again that I’m on maternity leave taking care of a baby and it is actually even more demanding than full time work. She ended the call quite upset.

My parents managed to access the accounts that were set up for my sister and I. They used it to pay for my brother's wedding. My sister didn't care because she got married two years out of high school and had no intention of going to college. 

When I graduated I went to the bank to get money for school and it was almost all gone.  There was like $13,000 left. 

I asked my parents about it and they said they had needed the money. I finally found out where the money went. I got furious. I got student loans and moved out. I am a great source of shame to them and I don't give two fucks.

I work at a wholesale warehouse in Minneapolis. It's a rather large company that prides themselves on being ""diverse"" but, knee deep into February I realized the company was not going to do anything to acknowledge black history month.  So I took it upon myself to put up a black history fact of the day in the break room. 

Before the day was done however, I was pulled aside by a manager that said that she was simply concerned. She told me that she wanted to make sure that I was using neutral wording and siting my references because I wouldn't want to make people uncomfortable in the workplace. 

I left that day feeling a little discouraged and overwhelmed with the new hoops I'd have to jump through if I still wanted to go through with this. Nevertheless I strapped my boots on, used my own printer and paper from home and got to work. The next day the same manager comes up to me with a list she made to ""help"" me. She wanted to make sure I showed the ""positive"" side of black history. I explained to her that I felt underrepresented in the company and that bringing this knowledge can spark conversations and hopefully bring people together. 

Her response to this was ""let me know if im crossing a line but I feel like God puts a hole in every person that can only be filled with him. So when you catch myself looking for outside representation, you should look to God instead."" With that comment, I thanked her for her list and she skipped away. Her list had Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan and Jackie Robinson on it as well as some other athletes. I did not go with her list, I went with people that made me feel good and facts based locally to more relate to people. For example,  one was about William Taylor's barbershop in St. Paul and how it used to be a stop on the underground railroad. 

My efforts were definitely not appreciated by my manager and even though black history month is over and the dust is now settled. She has been and still is actively ignoring me, it's gotten really awkward. I feel like I now have to be a model employee at all times, she may not be talking to be anymore but she sure is watching my work performance a lot more closely now. Waiting for an opportunity.

"People who grew up in those small, rural towns we all drive past: what was it like?","Rural southern Mississippi. Agricultural community, lots of farms and ranches.  My town had a population of around 600 people.  I was bused to a public school in a neighboring town of about 2,500 people.  I lived there from birth until I moved away to college, late 70s until early 90s.  It’s important to note that I am white and all of the families in my little community were white.

Pros: All the peace and privacy you could stand.  No one around me lived on less than 10 acres of property. Most people lived on 50 or more.  I had no neighbors in seeing distance.  When I was home alone I could crank up my guitar amp and absolutely no one could hear me.

It was also beautiful.  Gentle hills, plenty of mature trees.  Enough shade that the Southern summer wasn’t so rough.

You’d hear about the occasional drug crime or property crime, but anything other than petty crime was pretty rare.

Cons: Everything is inconvenient. The closest gas station was 12 miles away. The closest grocery store was 20 miles away.  The closest hospital was an hour long drive away.

We had to manage our own well water.  Most of my neighbors had septic tanks, but we were lucky enough to have a good hill for our house, so we had a gravity-based waste system. But that meant we had to stock a pond with fish and maintain a proper ecosystem, lest it turn into a cesspool.

Most people were small-minded.  They never ventured far from the area and never wanted to do so.  They knew almost nothing of other cultures.  Oddly enough, many of the older folks in my community, particularly the males, were more open minded because many of them had served in World War 2 or the Korean War.  They had actually seen more of the world and had somewhat more worldly views.

To say this community was conservative is an understatement.  Strongly anti-LGBTQ.  Strongly anti-abortion.  Strongly anti-government, and not particularly pro-military, oddly enough.  Most folks had tales of abusive small town judges or deputies.  Many men my father’s age had been drafted to serve in Vietnam and did not have fond memories of it.

Although no non-whites lived in my little community, the town where I went to school was about 30% African-American.  The casual racism was real.  Many of the children my age had parents who were part of school integration.  I had Black friends from youth sports leagues in another town, but only a couple of Black friends at my school.  In fact, I got barked at by both some good ol’ boys and a few Black male schoolmates for dancing with a Black lady friend of mine at a school dance.

I don’t regret the experience overall.  I made a few lifelong friends and learned a higher degree of self-sufficiency.

"AITA for telling my roommate’s bf that I’m a stripper?","NTA. Your roommate is insecure and immature. You did nothing wrong.",1,0,3467,3467,"I (21f) have been a stripper for about a year now. I’m open about it with people, my family knows what I do, I’m not ashamed of it at all. I was on the verge of being homeless when I started and now just recently I was able to pay my rent for a year.

I have 2 roommates. They know what I do, asked some questions about it in the beginning but they’re very accepting. People in our age group don’t tend to care.

The issue:

I was in the kitchen making myself some dinner when my roommate(also 21f) walked in with her boyfriend. He’s coming to visit for a few days. They started making themselves some food as well so we exchanged some small talk. He asked what I’m studying in school and I told him that I’m taking a break from school for a few months and pretty much just focusing on work. He asked what I do for work and I told him I’m a stripper. He was pretty much like “oh cool” and we moved on.

I finished up and went back into my room to eat. Didn’t think anything of it but I got a text from my roommate later that night. She said she “really didn’t appreciate me telling her bf that I’m a stripper especially dressed the way I was.” 

I was confused bc I was wearing shorts and a tank top which is what I literally always wear around the house and I also didn’t know her bf was coming so it’s not like I was planning it out. I told her that I’m sorry she was uncomfortable but i tell anyone who asks what I do because I’m not ashamed of it and I was just wearing what I normally do.

She said that “I should know better than anyone what a male mind is going to imagine when they see a woman wearing revealing clothes who then says she gets naked for money.” Then said that I’m used to seeking out male attention.

I truly didn’t know how to respond and still don’t, the conversation made me pretty uncomfortable and I’ve pretty much just tried to stay in my room the past few days. I am aware that the nature of my job is sexual and I know that some men will “fetishize” me for lack of a better word. So I do understand why she’d be upset about it I just don’t think I did anything directly wrong?

Edit: Yes I could afford to move out if I wanted to but I live in an expensive city and figured why bother because I could save more and have never had an issue with my roommates before. We all renewed our leases last month

While he is out partying in Miami with his boys, I suggest you go party at a lawyers office. Your husband sounds like he is very very controlling and abusive. The abuse might not be physical, but it is still there.",1,0,1021,1021,"Hello. I'm sorry, never posted something like this before. 

To be brief; my husband is going to Miami with a friend for a long weekend. I think this is great and supported the idea of this trip since the beginning. 

We have a 17 year old daughter (his biological child, but I've been around since she was 5 years old. I love her to pieces.) He told me tonight that he informed our daughter 'Elisa ' that she could not leave the house nor stay overnight at any of her friends houses while he is on vacation. This was news to me as well (he mentioned this at dinner with all of us in the same room.)

Understandably upset, Elisa asked why and what had she done  to be punished. My husband said she had done nothing, but she needed to be home the entire time because that was the only way he could trust that I would stay home as well. He said he didn't trust me not to ""stay out and party all weekend"" unless Elisa was home and I had to take care of her. My party days are long behind me but he brings them up constantly, many many years after the fact.

Aside from the logic being incredibly flawed here, I'm frankly disturbed by the fact he will punish her and jam up her extended weekend as a tool to ensure I do what he wants me to do. 

I told him flat out I thought what he did was unfair to Elisa and a little sick. He's now telling me it's my fault he had to resort to this because he can't trust me.

Your MIL might genuinely feel like your son is hers, but you CANNOT allow her to continue to expose your child to her mental and emotional issues.

Cut. Her. Off.


NTA",2,0,4899,4899,"I have a 4 yr old and I am due with baby #2 mid year. My husband (27) and I (25) have been together since we were teens. MIL (47) was jealous from the get go of our relationship. I’ve read up a bit on this, it’s to do with her not having their emotional needs met by a partner so they subconsciously use their son to meet those needs. 

Then when I fell pregnant with my now 4 yr old, she kept saying “my baby” and sometimes she would slip and start referring to hubby as our child’s “brother”. This continued my whole pregnancy and she would boast about it to anyone and everyone. Then when he was born it all amplified. She wanted to take him to spend alone time with him from the time he was a couple weeks old. And would be offended when we said no. She would always say that grandma loves him more than his parents do. She would kick up a giant stink whenever she wasn’t able to take him out alone, She never wanted to spend time with him around us. 

there were so many times where we tried to set boundaries but she would always do it her way and guilt trip us. When we would do things together she would physically push the pram out of my hands and she would push the pram EVERYWHERE anytime we were together “I’ll push my baby” and I was never allowed. she would never correct people if they assumed she was his mother. And as his parents we thought that was too weird. he is always “her grandson” but never ever is he our son. anytime we do anything it is ALWAYS about her. It’s like shes now using my son to meet her emotional needs which even though it’s subconscious, to me it’s SICK! I have tried to place more boundaries but always get met with guilt trips. 

when we go places together where my son will experience what I call “firsts” all of those things are taken over by her. Even just small details like going to buy a drink, she NEEDS to take him instead of us. she either takes him and does them without us or I’ll say hey maybe he could do that with his parents too and she will be unhappy and making sure that he holds HER HAND and he’s sitting next to her and not us, she always always makes sure if he comes over to me that she gets his attention back onto her. She constantly constantly tells him she loves him the most, he’s her favourite, he’s her favourite person, and any time we do anything together to make her the centre of his attention. 

now that I’m having another baby (also a boy) I have been worried it’ll be the same thing all over again. But it’s not. I caught her telling my son (don’t worry you will be grandmas favourite always you are grandmas boy you won’t have to share I’ll always be your favourite person) and that is just horrible. She is saying things like “you and grandma can do things together and mum and dad can have the new baby”. 

am I the asshole for thinking that this is just absurd behaviour!?

EDIT- We have had many talks.. me alone with her, him alone with her, us together with her, it always ends with her crying and guilt tripping us

EDIT 2- I understand it now after reading comments, sometimes it hard to look in from the outside when you are stuck on the inside. For a while there I thought taking her away may have been a bad decision because of how much he adores her. In my mind I was taking away someone he cherished. After reading the comments I can now see what it is from the outside looking in, just needed that boost to get there and get out of the box. The guilt I was feeling was mainly because of how he feels towards her, which now I get. How could a 4 year old not cherish someone who gives into his every whim? I get that now that’s actually manipulation but when you stand here and watch them and you watch how his eyes light up when she’s around and how excited he is, it does take a little bit of a shove to look at it from a different angle and have that realisation moment",4899,"Argodecay","One_hell_of_a_lifeee",0

So when I messaged my family introducing my son with his name - Oliver, the general response was positive- however my brother and his wife (both nearly 40) sent me a nasty text and wouldn’t speak to me. I didn’t understand why as it was a short message and didn’t explain anything- just that they were angry about his name. Since they wouldn’t speak to me I rang my sister. She explained that they had taken offence and that they thought the name was too similar to their daughter’s name - Olivia…. She explained they were very angry with us and not willing to speak to us at the moment. I was completely shocked and it’s all been very upsetting. 

I’ve spoken to my parents and my other sister who are also very confused by their reaction.

I (28f) and husband (30M) do not have kids. We both have decent paying jobs and a real estate. That said we love to travel and many times also pay & invite our families to go with us.
My brother (26M) married and had my nephew (4m) with my middle school best friend (28F). Yes, he married my best friend and we are still best friends. They had my nephew and years later divorced.

To the Point: My brother started dating his new GF we will call her Ashley. They’ve been together for around 9 ish months. They’re not engaged or married. She has a son who is 5, we will call him John. I’ve only met John a handful of times. He’s a nice kid but I don’t really know him. I only know Ashley on an first name basis in a way. We talk occasionally but nothing in depth.

I invited my ex SIL& nephew to Disney this summer for 6 days. 2 days in Disney, 1 in Universal. The remaining days would be chill/Orlando days.
We are paying for them to go. I’ve always wanted to take nephew to Disney since he was smaller. He loves Mickey! We didn’t tell him in front of John or Ashley. 
But it made it back to Ashley that we are taking him. She confronts me at a family dinner on the side& tells me she’s upset we are not including her child and that he should have been invited. She said he doesn’t feel like he fits in/ is family and that is excluding him from Disney has made him cry all night. I was so shocked.

We are easily paying $2k for my nephew & best friend to go. Tickets, airfare, lodging, and of course some toys. 

I blew up. I told her that I didn’t even know her or her kid. They have only been around for a few months & he’s not my nephew. I told her I didn’t like the entitled mentality and to make it a point I would make sure to exclude her from all future family gatherings. She left crying. My brother and parents are all upset with me. That I’m excluding this child& isolated them. I told them if they’d like to pay for them I don’t mind them tagging along but they all said “You have more means than us”. They’re not doing great financially which is why I didn’t ask in the beginning. She made a huge FB post and everyone is siding with her.

My bf has a camping trip with the guys every summer (been going for longer than the 7 years I’ve known him). This past year was a very hard one for me but it didn’t really get really bad until a few days before his trip. He offered to stay with me but I knew 1) it wouldn’t solve the problems I was having, 2) he needed a break, 3) I’m a grown woman and am capable of taking care of myself for 5 days.

I have a golden retriever named Nala and she is the sweetest. 

I'm Deaf, too. That bit is important. When I moved in, I had a bit of trouble having flashing light doorbells put in and there was a while I had to go without. My friends and family know to give me a call when they drop by instead of ringing the doorbell but unfortunately I have missed many a package this way. 

For some reason, Nala caught onto this. At one point she began letting me know when someone was at the door. She'd do this in multiple ways. If I was in the living room where I can see the front door,  she'd go and paw at the door, or if I was upstairs she'd come and gently headbutt me  to let me know someone's there. It took me a while to catch on to what she was trying to do, though. 

And now, even though I  have my doorbell installed she still does it. I did not teach her how to do any of this. She just decided to help me out lol.  

I brought a friend over for the first time recently. This is the first time she's met Nala as well. The first thing she comments on is how I named her Nala, because  apparently everyone and their grandma names their golden Nala. Lion King was my favorite movie growing up, sue me. 

Then I showed her a video of Nala pawing at the door because it got a bit awkward after that comment. It's usually a great ice breaker. She laughed and thought it was cute. I showed her another one. She asked me why Nala was doing that and I explained. 

She doesn't say anything for a minute and then goes ""So, she's basically your servant? Is she just here to get the door?""

She and her husband “Joe” (34M) haven’t been able to get the childcare situation totally sorted out and needed a babysitter last Saturday, so I agreed to watch Ella for the day while Riley was at work. 

I've been sort of the ""cool aunt"" ever since Ella was born. I typically will bring small gifts or activities whenever I know that I will be seeing her, which isn't all that often. Ella is a smart and engaged kid and I like to give her things that will interest her and keep her occupied.

One important piece of information here is that I'm a very crafty person. I have a small online store and also work with local businesses for selling and distributing small batches of my product - hand painted wooden figurines. I thought it might be fun to introduce Ella into my hobby/business, so I ended up bringing 10 unpainted figurines to choose from, a few tubes of acrylic paint, and some paint brushes. 

We immediately got to work and Ella was *so* into it. She had an absolute blast painting her turtle figurine. But when it came time for me to leave, I started packing up all of my supplies and Ella became visibly upset. Riley insisted that I leave the supplies behind so that Ella could keep and play with them. I disagreed, and basically said that I have no obligation to give away any of my belongings. 

I personally feel like I was more than generous by babysitting Ella on my day off (I do have a regular 9-5 job as well) and providing a fun activity for her. Riley pointed out that I have a pretty large stock of items at home, which is true, but still - letting Ella keep the supplies and figurines would've been a loss in profit for my business. Ella cried when I didn't let her keep any of the stuff and Riley argued that I should have never brought “toys” over if I wasn't willing to let Ella keep them. 

Now Riley hasn't been responding to any of my messages or calls and I can only assume she's still angry over this whole thing. I thought I was doing something nice by babysitting and providing a fun activity.

*""there is no such thing as an invalid reason. I don't care what Sadie's reason is,""*

*"" my problem is that she used the words LAZY and SELFISH,""*

Those are her reasons as stated by herself.   That you don't like them because they happen to conform to a stereotype you don't like is not her problem",1,0,1623,1623,"I always knew I didn't want to have kids. I don't have any specific reason for not wanting children, I just lack the desire and I strongly believe that the question should be ""why do you want kids?"" instead of ""why don't you want kids?"".

My older sister, Sadie, was very vocal about wanting to have children in her early 20s, but now that she is in her late 20s, she changed her mind.

Our parents never liked that I don't want kids, but they didn't care much about it either, since they knew Sadie will give them grandchildren. But now that Sadie changed her mind, they are panicking.

They invited us both over to dinner, then ""confronted"" us on why we don't want to have children and demanded a reason. I told them I just simply lack the desire and I expected Sadie to do the same, but instead, she threw me under the bus.

She decided to perpetuate the childfree stereotype and said that she is too lazy and selfish to have children. She doesn't want to start her mornings with making breakfast, getting the kids ready and taking them to school, she is just too lazy for that and doesn't want to give up her nice vacations and hobbies.
 
Thanks to her, now our parents are bugging me too and believe I'm a selfish, lazy person. I told Sadie she was wrong for telling our parents that's her reason and she should've thought about me before opening her mouth.

Sadie said she has every right to tell our parents whatever she wants and it's not her fault they are the way they are and that I can't stand up for myself. AITA?

Edit: She called herself lazy and selfish and that's what I have a problem with.

Edit 2: Again: nobody has to give a reason why they don't want kids, so no, there is no such thing as an invalid reason. I don't care what Sadie's reason is, my problem is that she used the words LAZY and SELFISH, which are the absolute worst childfree stereotypes.",1623,"Dazzling_Ad_2633","Life-Description-787",0

Last night, while I was leaving my boyfriends house, I forgot them in his room, and only realized the next day when it was time to take them. 

He works really early, and I work really late, so we figured it’d be inconvenient to wait till he was done, especially since it’s better to not delay my doses by too much time, so I just stopped at his job to grab his keys and went to his house.

My bf still lives with his parents, though we’re planning on moving in together this summer. 

When I got there, his dad was there, working from home. I wasn’t expecting this cause usually he works at his office. 

I didn’t think it’d be much of a big deal since my BF told me I could, but his dad was absolutely furious, and yelled at me that I can’t just “pop by randomly” to grab things. He sad he thought I was breaking in to steal things. He was really mad and kept saying that I was intruding.

I apologized and informed him of the situation with my meds. He angrily told me to grab them and get out. 

I talked abt it with my boyfriend, who told me it was his fault and that he should’ve warned his dad, but I can’t help but still feel a bit bad, and wonder if I was truly in the wrong, or if my bfs dad was overreacting?

"AITA for defying my stepfather's clothing rules?","NTA and what your stepfather is doing is a form of abuse called coercive control. It's a pattern of controlling behaviour which is aimed at every aspect of your individuality. It makes you feel like you are walking on eggshells and perpetually under scrutiny and criticism. Can you talk to a school counsellor? Do you have any other family who can take you in? Please remember that you are not the problem here. He is and so is your mother for enabling him and failing to protect you",3,0,1130,1130,"I (15F) live with my mom (36F) and stepfather (48M - SF). My father died when I was a baby and for most of my life, it has just been my mom and me. She met my now-stepfather a couple years ago and they got married last summer. 

It has been a huge adjustment to have SF in our family. Mostly because as compared to my mom, he is extremely strict. He convinced my mom that I am spoiled, entitled and need his harsher discipline or else I am never going to make anything of myself. When it was just my mom and me, our home seemed like a warm and loving place but now it feels like a boot camp, which makes sense because SF is ex-military. However, it feels unfair because I am not a bad kid by any means.

I have always gotten pretty much straight As. I do my homework without having to be told and always did whatever chores my mom assigned. I don't talk back or curse and at this point, am not interesting in dating like a lot of my friends are. I don't drink or do drugs and always follow my curfew.

However, SF decided that is not good enough. He demands perfection at school, like 100% on everything or else I get grilled over why I made a mistake. He decided I was a bit chubby so now I have to get up for 5 am runs/boot camp workouts and have to have weekly weight checks (my mom participates in this too because she wanted to lose weight). One of the worst things was that he decided most of my clothes are ""inappropriate."" I do not think they are, I don't wear anything revealing or skintight, but I did favor bright colors. SF decided I was being attention-seeking with my clothes and took away all my bright-colored stuff and replaced it with drab/neutral colors. Again my mom went along with this because he persuaded her that I just had no sense of what was appropriate from now growing up with a father.

Anyway to bring us to the current dilemma, of course St. Patrick's Day is this Friday and everyone at school wears green (or gets pinched). I am not allowed to wear green anymore because of SF's rules. Some friends were talking about what they are going to wear and I mentioned I can't participate this year. So one friend gave me a green T-shirt and suggested I wear it under my black sweater.

I had the T-shirt in my backpack but SF decided to search my backpack (he does random searches of all my stuff, I guess I was just hoping he wouldn't find the T-shirt). Of course he was furious and grounded me for a month. I tried to explain that I just wanted to participate in the tradition and that I was going to be wearing it under other clothes, so at most a small sliver of green would show, but this didn't fly. My mom agreed with the grounding and furthermore said she was incredibly disappointed in me because I have never broken rules and acted out before. I feel awful for disappointing her but also really do feel like the rule is stupid and pointless.

So, AITA for planning to wear a green T-shirt for St. Patrick's Day when I am not allowed to wear bright colors?",1130,"Purrminator1974","Historical_Plum6648",0
"AITA for not using the regular public restroom?","According to the American Restroom Association, they're ADA accessible, single stall restrooms and,although family style, are meant for all to use. (NTA)",17,0,192,192,"First, allow me to set the scene: I was out at Dave & Busters in my local mall (for those who don't know what that is, it's an arcade/restaurant partially aimed at adults but obviously families bring kids too). It was a Monday evening and not particularly crowded, though there were a handful of families with small children there. 

Now, let me give some relevant context: When I was younger, I had a traumatic event happen to me in a public restroom which has resulted in me having anxiety surrounding the use of public bathrooms. it's not *impossible* for me to use them, but it's difficult (I have to very mindfully calm my panic response) and it ends up taking longer than typical to do my business, even just #1.. (sorry if that's TMI, I just want to be thorough in explaining the context)

Ok, now that we have that out of the way...
So I'm at D&B with a friend and have to go to the bathroom. I know they have one of those 'family' restrooms that is just a large single room/stall where you can lock the door and not worry about anyone else being in there, so I try the door and no one is using it so I go ahead and lock the door behind me and just as I sit on the toilet, the door handle jiggles. damn. ""occupied!"", I call out & just hear a muffled grunt in response. This, unfortunately, does kick in a bit of an anxiety response, but I calm myself & do what I gotta do - all in all, I was in the bathroom for just under 7 minutes (i noticed the time when I sat down and looked again after washing my hands)

When I come out, there's a woman waiting with her toddler who, upon seeing me exit alone, starts going off on me and telling me I have no business using a family restroom, especially in an establishment where there's clearly always going to be families around who may need it.

I just apologized and said that it was available and there weren't very many families in the facility at the time anyway and explained that I had a good enough reason for using it myself. She scoffed at this and asked what excuse could *possibly* have for taking away a facility (albeit briefly) from the families it was created for in the first place.

I don't really feel that my trauma is anyone's business so I told her, as calmly as I could muster, that my reasons are none of her business and either way, it's available now, so go ahead and use it. And then I walked away. I was feeling a little shook up and when I mentioned it to my friend, he agreed that I was kinda the AH cuz I could have just gone out into the mall area and probably found a family restroom to use out there.. (there were maybe 20, at most, people milling about the rest of the mall area)

From my religious perspective, it’s better when agnostics and atheists are decent people because they’re doing it because it’s the right thing to do, not to gain an advantage.",2,0,6,6,"So I'm (17F) in high school and I'm bisexual and agnostic. My family is very religious, and though my parents support LGBTQ+ people and the community they grew up in households with very strict parents, and thus are incredibly loyal to their parents. I'm not the same way - I speak my mind if and when I want to - and this detail is one of the most important aspects of the story.

It's also important to know that I hate hugging. Sometimes, if I'm in the mood, I'll let my friends or younger cousins hug me, but I hate hugging adults because as a kid, grown adults pulled me into hugs at church all the time and I grew to dislike it immensely. I constantly say how much I hate hugging people, but my family tries to force hugs on me all the time, even when I say I'm uncomfortable. They think it's funny when I shove them off me or they try to guilt-trip me by using the family card, especially my parents, who say they can touch/hug me whenever they want because they're my parents.

Tonight, my grandmother made us all have prayer. I felt awkward because I'm agnostic and my grandma would throw a fit if she found out, but my dad made me join anyway. She rambled on about how we need God in our schools and how school shootings, electronics, and LGBTQ+ people are bad for students, which I kind of rolled my eyes to. My dad asked us to name one thing that God had given us that we're grateful for, and I got so stuck on the word ""God"" that I couldn't answer the question. It's stupid, but I froze. My grandma ripped into me, bringing up my illness and how God did this and that for me. I answered sarcastically because I didn't know what to say, but my dad was annoyed with me.

Then, we said an ending prayer and everyone hugged. My grandma beelined straight for me. I tried to sidestep her, but she blocked me and made me hug her. It was an awkward hug; at first I tried to give her a side hug, but she made me wrap both arms around her. It was extremely uncomfortable, but I thought that was that.

However, my dad pulled me aside. He said that I had to apologize to my grandmother and give her a ""real"" hug to show her that I'm sorry. I agreed to apologize, but I didn't want to hug her because, as I said, I *hate* hugging people. He kept saying ""I get it, I get it, but we all have things that we don't want to do"" and, frustrated, I yelled at him because it seemed like he *didn't* understand what the problem was - the fact that I don't care for physical affection and that I'm uncomfortable to express beliefs in things I don't necessarily believe in - even though he kept saying he *did* understand it.

She already made me hug her once, so I don't understand why I have to do it again.

I have a lot of respect for my parents since they're hardworking, but this pissed me off and I may be the asshole for yelling at my father and storming off. Maybe I should've tried to act less uncomfortable. I just would like some clarity to figure out who's in the wrong here so I can mitigate the situation.",6,"srgonzo75","utterstupiditee",0

Each time she offers me food I always make up some kinda excuse to avoid eating it and try to be as polite as possible about it.

But unfortunately for me after I invited her to dinner she felt compelled to do the same for me even when I told her it's not necessary.

The next day after the dinner we had together she started making plans with my husband, when my husband brought it up to me I told him I really didn't want to go to which he replied my mom's food is not that bad could you please just deal with it for one day.

It didn't go to well she was really offended and told me that she'll never cook for my ungrateful ass again and told my husband.

My husband is really disappointed in me because he felt like I should've just pretended to keep the peace and is upset that now my mil doesn't even want to invite me over again.

"WIBTA? for no longer sharing with my roommates?","NTA. They don't want to share with you. You don't need to share with them.

Adults going out without their keys is a very college situation; I wonder if they left the keys on purpose, expecting to wake you. The benefits include not having to worry about losing keys and disturbing you. Perfect that you didn't hear them, you're not responsible for them.

Does the university own the apartment? If so, you could ask the housing office to move you elsewhere now due to hostility. If not, just don't engage and make your arrangements for next year. I'm sorry this is happening to you.

I had a TV in college dorms, tiny one and my roommate would sit up after I'd gone to bed, watching TV, meaning I didn't sleep and asked jer not to watch after i went to bed; i went to bed at 12 or midnight and she had the tv on atv2, 3, 4. I asked to put it in a friend's room and took it home next time I went. Didn't say a word to her, it was my TV. 

Others told me she was upset but there was nothing she could do. It was mine.",4,0,83,83,"I (F19) am a uni student living with three other girls who are also all (F19). We started the year all being friends. In Dec, the girls told me that they don't want to live with me next year. Weeks prior to this, they would blatantly leave me out and I could see that the dynamic was different, so this was something that I was already considering. However, after some time, things were better and we began to hang out again.

However, one day the girls went out to the club and I wasn't given an invite. I wasn't too fazed by this, as that night I had a really bad migraine and wouldn't have gone out anyways.

I am a really deep sleeper, and I am not easily awoken. This is usually not a problem, however,  this night the girls all forgot their keys and  couldn't let themselves into the apartment at 2am after the club. My door was closed, and me being a deep sleeper, I  didn't hear them knocking. Especially since I took my migraine medication which knocks me out. Anyways, they had to call security to let them in. Which they may or may not have been charged for.

The next morning, I woke up to missed calls and was confused. I then asked one of the girls what happened, and I could tell she was a bit upset (I can see why. But Im not  sure how it is my fault?).

Anywho, after this the girls haven't spoken to me and it's probably been over 2 months, despite us all living together. 

They continue to hang out, and even talk about me loud enough so that I can hear. Also, every time all three of them leave, they shout ""did everyone lock their doors?"", implying  I would steal from or something. 

When we first moved in, we all contributed stuff to the apartment, and all allowed each other to use what we brought. However, I am  realizing certain things  are no longer in the common areas to be shared.

Moreover, I share a bathroom with 1 of the girls. I opened my pack of toilet paper first that we have both been using. When my pack was empty, I went to replace it, and realized she removed hers. I have no problem buying my own, I just find it odd that she continued to use mine if she planned on being stingy. I also have always provided the hand soap from bath and body works (almost $10 a bottle) and never felt a way about her using it. I even shared my bathroom shelves with her so that she could store some of her things in the bathroom for convenience.

WIBTA, if I removed my hand soaps from the bathroom and no longer restocked the bathroom with toilet paper?

Furthermore, for the kitchen appliances and tools that they have decided that they no longer wanted to share, WIBTA if I removed all the dishes, cups, cutlery and pots and pans from the kitchen that I brought? This would leave them with nearly nothing to eat or cook with.

Am I not this type of person, and have never had a problem sharing however it seems unfair.",83,"Emotional_Bonus_934","Quick-Needleworker-4",0

I have complained to Tom and Tom's mom that Lily's jokes weren't funny and she should stop, but they always said she was just joking. I told Eni that she should return the jokes to Lily, but she can never think of anything to say.
Last year I was invited to Tom's family's Christmas party, everything was fine until Lily said something like ""Oh God Eni, you've already eaten so much, at this pace you'll stop being Pigni to become Whalni"" and she laugh with the children at the party. I was furious and Eni and Tom gave a fake laugh and said that Eni was 4 months pregnant. When we were all congratulating them, Lily said ""wow, at least now you can excuse yourself when people see you eating like a pig."" I got furious again but Eni asked me to just let it go but I know how much that jokes hurt her. So I went back to having a talk with Tom and his mother about why Lily's teasing had to stop.
 Well, this weekend was Eni's babyshower, we were having a good time until Lily told another joke about how ""fat"" Eni had gotten, I had enough so I laughed so loud to attract attention and said ""Oh Lily, you're so funny, especially when you finish your jokes with that ugly pig laugh, sometimes I think people laugh more at your laugh than at your joke."" Lily got super serious and she told me it wasn't funny, to which I said ""come on, it's a joke"" and imitated her laugh, the kids at the party laughed too and Lily ran away while she cried. Tom's mother scolded me for the joke and I asked her why Lily's jokes were funny but mine weren't, if they both had a pig joke in it, and her mother couldn't answer me. I told her that every time I heard Lily tell a joke about Eni, I would return the joke. Eni told me that I shouldn't have done that, but I could see her hold back her laughter along with the other guests, but I'm tired of Eni being walked over.

Cry me a river, every parent has to make sacrifices. This woman dumped her child on your doorstep after you said ""no"" to watching her child because she wanted to socialize. It wasn't an emergency, she just didn't want to cancel her plans.",66,0,42,42,"EDIT: **AITA for how I handled my brother's girlfriend trying to force ME to babysit?** I'm not sure how to edit the title, but yes it is a mistake.

I am 30F, I have a brother, Matt (35), who has been with his girlfriend Lexi (33) for 2 years. Lexi has a daughter, Bella (5). I have a daughter who is 3yo.

We all live in the same city, but Matt and Lexi live in suburbs, and I live in the city centre, so about 45 minutes away. While I see Matt on average every 3 weeks, I only see Lexi and Bella every 2/3 months at my parents' house or for occasions/gatherings.

2 days ago I got a text from Lexi asking me to babysit Bella on Wednesday because she would not be at school due to teachers being on strike. She said she forgot about the strike and had not taken the day off work, and had also made social plans for after her shift ended. I said no to babysitting and thought that was that.

Yesterday, around lunchtime, I was having a skin treatment when one of my cleaners came to tell me that Lexi had dropped off Bella. The cleaner had answered the door and Lexi had said she had arranged to leave Bella with us, and the cleaner was unaware this wasn't the plan and let her in, Lexi then left. I was livid. I immediately called Lexi, and after 4 declined calls and voicemails I sent her a text saying if she didn't return for her daughter within 15 minutes I was going to call the police to say she had abandoned her child. I find my husband to tell him what is going on, and he calls Matt, and tells him to sort this out. A few minutes after speaking to Matt, Lexi reappears. She marched straight into the den where Bella is watching TV, saying how evil we were for telling Matt and threatening to call the police. I tried to get her to come and speak in the study so Bella couldn't hear but she just kept going on. I reminded her that she intentionally abandoned her child, but she kept going on about how she was desperate and needed to go to this social arrangement and how she never has time to do anything. I reiterated that be that as it may, she can't just leave Bella with us when we didn't agree to it. Lexi kept bring up excuses until my husband lost it and told her in no uncertain terms to leave. By this point Bella was in hysterics and Lexi seemed totally frazzled.

This has since turned into a big thing. Lexi has been posting cryptic things on social media about how hard it is to be a mother when 'people you expect to be there for you' won't help you. I've received texts from her saying Bella is devastated to find out that we don't like her (I've now blocked Lexi). My parents have heard about it and while my mother is firmly on my side, my dad said was it really worth upsetting Bella when she was already there. Matt says that while Lexi was in the wrong, once she had left we probably should have just kept Bella and argued about it later. Matt also thinks my husband owes Lexi an apology for intimidating her, which I don't think he does.",42,"Heloise_Morris","Certain_Biscotti_127",0

"AITA for stepping away from gift-giving with my step-children?","NTA",1,0,2486,2486,"
I (50f) been in a relationship with my husband (52m) for several years, we've been married a year and there have been many gift-giving situations throughout. I’ve always been the one to make things happen - someone wants something I figure out how to get it done. I've always been involved in the gift selection process for his children who are both in their mid/late-20s (1m, 1f). On my side of the family we've never done the step- words...and as it pertains to them it's always been **the** kids or **our** kids. I've used it in this title in case you feel it is pertinent. 

So here is my issue...in each of these instances I do not get a thank you, I barely get a vague acknowledgment. I did get an awkward ""um uh um thanks I guess"" on one birthday. Gift-giving has been mostly initiated/pre-planned by me. I usually enjoy it.  I know it's not that the gifts have not been good gifts. I have overheard on more than one occasion one or both of them bragging about what their dad got them and how he's really stepped up his gift-giving game these days. It's hurtful. There's a lot of real estate between a hearty pat on the back and the disrespect I feel. Something in the middle would be nice.  I pay attention throughout the year to what they state their current interests are, an item they drool over, causes they like to support, etc. and what I would give for just a look-me-in-the-eye thank you sometimes. 

Most recently, 1 had a baby showers and there were multiple tables FULL of gifts from 55 different people...54 of them got a 'thank you'. Guess who didn't. The slight was so obvious that another woman turned around, laughed and said ""they didn't say it so I will...thank you!"" Yeah, not funny but I'll play it off, ""it's all good haha pregnancy brain."" 

I get excited about gift-giving and how much they'll love something and I just end up feeling lousy afterwards. Honestly, now that I'm typing this out I realize that they know proper etiquette it really is that they just don't think it applies to me for some reason. 

So AITA for telling their dad that I will NEVER disapprove of any money he wants us to spend on anything he wants to give to his children, I'm just no longer comfortable putting myself in that position when there is so little (or no) appreciation?

9. Always more with ones like this, I’m sure I missed something.",159,0,2864,2864,"My husband and I have 6 children total and live in 4 bedroom house. We have two sons together (8 & 6), I have a son from a previous relationship (15), and I have 3 step children (20F, 16M & 16F). We live in a 4 bedroom house and for most the time we lived there we had 2 kids per room with the youngest boys sharing, the older boys sharing and the girls sharing. 

Things changed a couple years ago. My oldest stepdaughter finished school and is attending university locally. The girls decided at this point that instead of sharing a bedroom at their dads and sharing a bedroom at their mums, they would each take 1 room as their permanent bedroom. So the 16 yr old lives with us full time and the 20 yr old lives with her mum full time. They both visit the other parents house regularly. 

My 16 yr old stepson has his own bedroom at his mum's house but still splits time between each parents house mostly 50/50. My son lives full time with us as he doesn't have much of a relationship with his dad. My son and stepson do not get on that well and they can often be heard screaming at each other in their bedroom. 

Recently, I asked my stepson why he doesn't move to live full time with his mum so he and my son can have a similar arrangement as their sisters. This way both of the boys would have their own rooms. He would obviously still visit like his older sister does and we could figure something out like a futon instead of a bed in their room so my son has more space when stepson's not there. 

My stepson overreacted to my suggestion and is trying to make out like I'm kicking him out, when really I'm just thinking of a better use of space. It's unfair that all the older kids but my son have their own rooms at one of their parents house. My son likes the idea and has brought it up to his stepbrother a few more times since I originally suggested it and it has caused arguments between them. He now seems to be considering it. 

My husband is angry with me for suggesting his son moving permanently to his mums. He thinks that he and his son would have a less close relationship if this happens (my husband favours his oldest son over our boys). He also thinks I'm making his son feel like he's being forced out. However, it was his daughters already doing the same thing that gave me the idea because it worked out well for them and they both seem happier.

Me: (answers phone call) Lab, this is Ashley.
UC: Hi Kim, could you send us down a few viral swabs when you get a moment?
Me: Sure! ...Can I ask you a question?
UC: Go ahead!
Me: Why do you think my name is Kim? You're not the only one who does it, I either get called Kim or Kate. I'm not upset or anything. I'm just trying to understand why.
UC: (sounding kind of offended) I thought that's what you said. What did you say?
Me: No, I said Lab this is Ashley.
UC: (acting like I'm verbally attacking them) Well I thought you said Kim (hangs up)

For context. I do not know if I have spoken to this person specifically before but for the duration that I have worked here I have always answered the phone the same way and on a weekly basis get called Kate/Kim. I wasn't trying to call this person out specifically I was genuinely trying to ask why they thought I said Kim. I keep trying to figure it out but Ashley and Kim sound nothing alike.

But I'd probably tell Jamie the truth purely as he's your friend too and if it's that important he should knkw",2,0,5097,5097,"My (29F) friend Kate (28) has a boyfriend, Jamie (29), whom she has been with for nearly 3 years. We met Jamie on a night out, and I would say that although he's Kate's bf I consider him a friend. We share an interest in a particular sport that we text about sometimes and if I have a spare hospitality ticket to one of the sporting fixtures, I will sometimes invite Jamie to go. 

Jamie's 30th is coming up and Jamie and Kate planned a big party, and I peripherally helped out with logistics when asked. 

A few days ago, Kate texted me. She asked if I wouldn't mind ""toning down"" my look for the party, and if I could send her a picture of what I was planning to wear. I asked her what this meant and after asking several times if she ""really had to say it"" she asked if I could dress (verbatim) ""basically what \[I\] would consider frumpy"" because she really didn't want to be outshone at her own boyfriend's birthday party. When I didn't reply right away she went on to say that she wanted Jamie's full attention that night, which she wouldn't get if I showed up dressed properly. I was a bit annoyed by what she was implying so I said if I was going to be so much of a concern for her, I'd rather just politely decline the invitation. Kate freaked out saying I was being immature by not coming just because I couldn't steal the spotlight. I said it wasn't about that, it was about her making me responsible for whether or not I draw her boyfriend's attention, which is something I've never tried to do nor done as far as I'm aware. She then said it was really important to Jamie that she stand out because his friends and colleagues would be there. I just told her that again, if she was so worried I was going to be distracting everyone, I'd rather not come than feel humiliated from now until the event. I said I would send her Jamie's gift and she could tell him why I wasn't coming. 

I guess she didn't tell him the reason because Jamie messaged me saying he knows I'm ""booked"" the night of the party but he'd really like it if I could be there, and asked if I could reorganise so I could come. I hadn't replied, but I got a message from Kate saying she knows Jamie is trying to get me to come and please could I just put my pride aside and come to the party. I asked if she was going to ditch the outfit policing, but she said no, so I said I would not be coming. She didn't reply, but I've since received a couple of texts from mutual friends saying that while her request is ridiculous, Kate is aware of that, she's just desperate to be seen a certain way and even if it's pathetic I would probably feel the same way in her shoes. Other friends I've told (who don't know Kate) say I should not bow to the pressure and that she's nuts for even asking, and I don't disagree, but also I feel bad skipping the party when it's Jamie's birthday and he asked specifically that I come.

"AITA for “complaining” to my boyfriend for not being able to pick me up from my bus?","Nta. Run.",1,0,38,38,"Hi Reddit! So my (21f) boyfriend (22m) bought me a bus ticket a few days back for me to visit him in his city for the weekend. 

I told him I’d be there 30 minutes in advance that way he could come a little earlier/later to get me. He then texted me about 15 minutes later that he would be near a street close to where I was dropped off. I assumed he was already here since he does live 15 minutes away so when I got off the bus, I went looking for him until he texted saying to “lookup *street name* I’m on my way”. Turns out he didn’t leave his apartment yet. 

I’ll admit, I got a little irritated because I thought he’d at least be close enough to pick me up. He then called me and told me he didn’t know if he was gonna be able to pick me up because the roads were closed off and there was traffic. There was a huge event in the city that I had no idea about until I got there. I told him I didn’t know and he then went on about how he didn’t know the roads would be closed off.

This is where I may be the AH. I told him that nearly all the passengers had left already because someone picked them up. But he said he couldn’t come and that he was getting anxious (he hates driving) and said “I’m doing my best”, which led to him getting mad at me and telling me I was complaining and he turned around to go home. 

He said he’d call an Uber for me so I said okay. At this point, all the passengers had left. We started arguing on the phone about how I thought he was already here from what he texted me and he called things like, “verbally abusive”, “manipulator”, but the worst were him calling me a “bitch” and to “go to hell”. To which, I told him he was acting like a child. I didn’t feel comfortable staying with him anymore so I told him I’d try to find a hotel to stay at. That ended up not happening because of how expensive they were for me.

I got a text saying the Uber arrived but I couldn’t find the car. I looked around but nothing. My bf then got angry and told me the driver canceled and then he expected me to pay him back the $40 for the bus ticket and money for the Uber. To which, I did not. 

I stayed outside for nearly 3 hours and it was pretty cold and I was starving. I tried staying inside the lobby of the hotel I was dropped off at but was asked to leave later on. I wasn’t comfortable walking around especially with it being almost midnight in the city with my luggage and my tote bag.

I called my best friend and asked if he knew anyone I could stay with and he told me that the best option would be to stay with my bf so I eventually told my bf to come. I went with it because I was tired and very. He came to pick me up and said he told his friend what happened and now his friend is calling me a manipulative AH.

He let me move in mid month and it was a huge favor. He was pretty chill about letting me actually move my stuff before that. Huge help because I had to do everything by myself.

Been here a few days shy of a month. First two weeks were extremely relaxed and he wasn’t perfectly cleanly but it was tolerable. After the two weeks things have gone down hill a little. He hasn’t put his dishes in the dishwasher, they’re still sitting in the sink after two weeks. I offered Sunday night to put them away in the morning if he put his dishes in the dish washer to try and get him to actually doit. Woke up the next morning, they weren’t done. I gave him til the next day, still not done. So I started my dishes and put them away. I had cleaned the kitchen on the 5th while he was on a date with his girlfriend. And the next day he meal prepped. He left pieces of food on the counter… it’s been there since and I’m refusing to clean his mess up again.


He came to me in the morning telling me his brother was going to move in next month. I didn’t really care, I asked how his brother was since I don’t know him. He said “I know you probably don’t think I’m not clean but he’s not as clean as me but he’s not really that bad.” I stressed to him I didn’t want the house more messed up. He said he’s going to make sure his brothers not messy. For obvious reasons I have my doubts.


Mid day we talked and he said he was going to lower my rent $100 because I’m going to have to share my bathroom with him because he doesn’t wanna move his office.

I’m really not cool with having to share my bathroom cause I’m pretty close to being a clean freak and I’ll lose my cool if his brother is a slob in the bathroom.I also don’t like the fact that he’s going to charge his brother and I $1000 each starting next month. I currently pay $1100 and it’s only $100 off now for a room+ shared bathroom +more uncleanliness while he pays $300+utilities.

Her subsequent attempts at contacting me have been notes and messages that basically say she ""forgives me"" and ""wishes I stop being so stubborn"", completely dismissing any responsibility on her part.

We were over the moon and excited to tell family. I live far away from my family so mainly communicate over a family group chat. I don’t get to see them very often as it’s expensive to fly, and they all have kids too so it makes travelling a bit tricky. 

So when I messaged my family introducing my son with his name - Oliver, the general response was positive- however my brother and his wife (both nearly 40) sent me a nasty text and wouldn’t speak to me. I didn’t understand why as it was a short message and didn’t explain anything- just that they were angry about his name. Since they wouldn’t speak to me I rang my sister. She explained that they had taken offence and that they thought the name was too similar to their daughter’s name - Olivia…. She explained they were very angry with us and not willing to speak to us at the moment. I was completely shocked and it’s all been very upsetting. 

I’ve spoken to my parents and my other sister who are also very confused by their reaction. My sister-in-law has said to them that they might be willing to allow us to use Oliver as a middle name but if we use it as a first name that that will essentially lead to an end of relationship between us and them. 

I don’t feel I have to justify or ask permission for naming my son and feel they are being controlling with double standards. They’ve never asked anyone permission for naming their children, nor have any of my other siblings… We have different last names and there’s nearly 5 years between their Olivia and my Oliver, not to mention we live in different countries.

Well, he was making a video yesterday with some fairly expensive jeans he copped from a local custom designer. They are light pink and he was having trouble finding a shirt to match. He came out to the kitchen complaining, and I told him to wear this tee I got for his birthday last month. I told him the pattern had some pink in it and would match well with pink jeans.

Caden immediately started yelling and kicking off. He insisted that they weren’t pink, and accused me of gaslighting him. He said they were red and I just had an agenda of masculating him. These jeans are literally rose pink, so I was definitely not gaslighting him.

He called our mom at work (this was during her lunch hour) and told her what I said. My mom took Caden’s side and accused me of raining on my brothers parade by making him feel bad about his new clothes. I replied that I don’t think guys wearing pink is bad, and Caden is just making drama over nothing.

Update: from what everyone has said I am clearly NTA. Thank you all for your concern and well wishes. Ana and her family have been blocked and I will no longer be in contact with her.

My situation happened really recently (allot more recent than whatever the previous post was) I’m shocked to hear this has happened befor, but yeah it’s 💯 not related to ours haha


Finally I’ve had a few comments about my dog being “certified” that I want to clarify. I am not from the US so I’m unsure what your guys process is like, but all I mean is that Bailey has gone through the required testing, training and registration to ensure she is legally aloud to be classified as a service animal :) 


I just want to start by saying I’m pretty sure I’m not the A-hole. But my friend and her family are pretty certain that I am. Please bear with me, I’m just wanting some clarity over this situation to make sure I’m not crazy.

I (24 f) have epilepsy. I have a service dog (fully certified) who is trained to help me with my seizures. I have been diagnosed since a child, and I have had my current dog Bailey for 4 years now and she is the bestest girl around. (Before Bailey I had a previous service dog who we had to retire due to age… but having a service animal is by no means new for me). With her being a service dog she is obviously always with me. 

I have a core friend group who hangs out quite often. My one friend; let’s call her Anna) (also 24f) always makes really weird and almost passive aggressive comments about me and Bailey? Ex; dogs shouldn’t come to restaurants, I’m inconveniencing people, etc. she doesn’t get that I legitimately need her for my own safety. It’s not just for show.

My seizures are really regular; for context I actually get two different kinds. My “small ones” are petit Mal seizures. This essentially just looks like I’m zoning out and staring into space. Quite often people who don’t know me wouldn’t even connect this. My “big ones” are my main concern; these are focal seizures where I fully lose consciousness. This can happen a couple times a day for me so it’s obviously really important that I manage it to the best of my abilities. 

Anyways. Our friend Anna wanted to host a games night/appy night type thing at her house. When we there she lost it on me. She told me it was increadibly disrespectful that I showed up with Bailey without asking for permission first. That I can’t just assume people will be happy with a dog always being around. That I should have just stayed home if I couldn’t handle being out for a few hours without Bailey. I tried apologizing and pointing out that I assumed she knew I was bringing her since I’ve never gone anywhere without her. That set her off more. The guys were finally able to calm her down but her “compromise” was I had to put Bailey in the backyard.

I was an idiot and said fine because I didn’t want to inconvenience anyone more or continue stirring the pot. Bailey went out side and I returned inside with my friends. 

I ended up having a seizure, blacking out and smashing my head on the floor. I had to go to the hospital because of how hard I hit my head. 

I guess my friend group absolutely handed Ana her ass calling her hateful, toxic, and a jealous witch. I guess she was trying to say that I passed out for the attention and I got my way like always. Long story short no one wants her around anymore.

Since this happened her, her sister and mom have been blowing up my phone, calling me the ass hole and demanding I fix this situation and it’s honestly getting to me.. so Reddit. AITA?",9500,"Foxy_locksy1704","throwaway9876402",0

"AITA for refusing to go to my friend's bf's party after she demanded to approve my outfit?","YTA
It happend to me. Meeting my exboyfriend the same night as my exbest friend, she wasn't considering him like my boyfriend at that time but more like a friend, they had interests in common. At the end the attention he was putting was on her mostly everywhere we were going. My confidence was lost, and my ex best friend wasn't understanding why I was asking her just to not dress in a certain way in the meetings, just because of this insecurities I was having. At the end he was into her, they had sex, and I was losing my time with some idiot. It's important to find someone that makes you feel that you're the number 1 no matter what. Jamie is the asshole, you are the asshole for not talking openly with her what's going on and why she feels that way, you don't see she is not okay?",0,0,5097,5097,"My (29F) friend Kate (28) has a boyfriend, Jamie (29), whom she has been with for nearly 3 years. We met Jamie on a night out, and I would say that although he's Kate's bf I consider him a friend. We share an interest in a particular sport that we text about sometimes and if I have a spare hospitality ticket to one of the sporting fixtures, I will sometimes invite Jamie to go. 

Jamie's 30th is coming up and Jamie and Kate planned a big party, and I peripherally helped out with logistics when asked. 

A few days ago, Kate texted me. She asked if I wouldn't mind ""toning down"" my look for the party, and if I could send her a picture of what I was planning to wear. I asked her what this meant and after asking several times if she ""really had to say it"" she asked if I could dress (verbatim) ""basically what \[I\] would consider frumpy"" because she really didn't want to be outshone at her own boyfriend's birthday party. When I didn't reply right away she went on to say that she wanted Jamie's full attention that night, which she wouldn't get if I showed up dressed properly. I was a bit annoyed by what she was implying so I said if I was going to be so much of a concern for her, I'd rather just politely decline the invitation. Kate freaked out saying I was being immature by not coming just because I couldn't steal the spotlight. I said it wasn't about that, it was about her making me responsible for whether or not I draw her boyfriend's attention, which is something I've never tried to do nor done as far as I'm aware. She then said it was really important to Jamie that she stand out because his friends and colleagues would be there. I just told her that again, if she was so worried I was going to be distracting everyone, I'd rather not come than feel humiliated from now until the event. I said I would send her Jamie's gift and she could tell him why I wasn't coming. 

I guess she didn't tell him the reason because Jamie messaged me saying he knows I'm ""booked"" the night of the party but he'd really like it if I could be there, and asked if I could reorganise so I could come. I hadn't replied, but I got a message from Kate saying she knows Jamie is trying to get me to come and please could I just put my pride aside and come to the party. I asked if she was going to ditch the outfit policing, but she said no, so I said I would not be coming. She didn't reply, but I've since received a couple of texts from mutual friends saying that while her request is ridiculous, Kate is aware of that, she's just desperate to be seen a certain way and even if it's pathetic I would probably feel the same way in her shoes. Other friends I've told (who don't know Kate) say I should not bow to the pressure and that she's nuts for even asking, and I don't disagree, but also I feel bad skipping the party when it's Jamie's birthday and he asked specifically that I come.

Since her daughter's birth, she always insisted that I go to her place if I ever wanted to hang out. Even though she lives about 45 minutes away from me, I always did it in the beginning because I did value our friendship, and Katie was her first, so I could understand how she'd be stressed with a newborn.

Recently, I started to put my foot down and wanted her to meet me halfway. I felt like her kid (she only has Katie) was old enough to handle being outside and I was tired of driving just to hang at her house. We always picked a place halfway, so I felt like it was doable. 

During the last three hangouts, she was over 30 minutes late, and each time she claimed that she got ""mom privileges"" for being late because she had to wrangle her kid into the car and do other ""mom things"" I wouldn't understand (according to her. I'm childless). 

She asked to hang out this past weekend, and I told her that if she was late again, I'd leave. Lo and behold, the day came and she was late. After 30 minutes, I got up and left, but went to hang in the coffeeshop across the street because I was curious just how late she'd be. She was over an hour late, and when she found out from the waitress that I left, she started to call and text me. 

She said that I was callous and selfish for making her drive 25 minutes away from home with a toddler only to leave, and that she only ever came out for my benefit. I told her that I hang out with multiple friends who bring their kids out with us, and they're never late, so it was pretty shitty to blame being late on Katie (who is a perfectly sweet girl. She's never been a problem during our outings). Samantha just kept pulling the ""you're not a mom so you wouldn't get it"" card. 

I heard later from a mutual friend that Samantha has been blasting me in their mommy group and said I was bullying her for putting her child first. I feel like her reaction wouldn't be so strong unless she was actually upset, so I'm starting to kind of feel like an AH. I mean, she's right that I don't ""get it"" as I don't have children, but I still feel annoyed that she's late and feel justified for leaving. My time is precious too!

You're dragging this out in order to get maximum convenience for yourself, and keeping your husband on just enough of a hook to keep using him.  Put the poor man out of his misery and divorce him already.",50,0,25,25,"Since I (37M) came out as a trans man, my (straight) husband (46M) is having a hard time coping. To make things easier and to allow myself space to figure myself out, I moved out of his house (legally, his parents' house) a few months ago. I did the budgetary math, and I can afford to live by myself. I even let him keep my dog, because I felt that he needed a companion staying in the house that we lived in all alone.

To help me save money, Husband has generously allowed me to do laundry at his house once a week so that I don't have to pay for the laundry machine at my apartment complex. He is also holding some of my stuff for me since it won't all fit in my apartment, so that I don't have to rent a storage unit. However, he is also showing a strong reluctance to letting me go, insisting on calling every day to check up on me and getting us dinner when I go to do the laundry. I am concerned that he is not giving himself the chance to get over me.

I am a teacher, and next week is spring break in my district. I was planning on spending spring break relaxing, doing housework, and writing lesson plans for the next few weeks. In other words, spending it at my own pace. However, my husband has other plans.

See, we have this friend who has a 9-year-old son and lives a few counties away. The child is nice enough in small doses, but despite his age, he doesn't seem to have ever been taught that sometimes adults want some personal space and/or alone time. Husband has offered for her to stay at his house with the child during this week, due to work that she has to do during that week. I'm not concerned about Husband possibly cheating; I know Friend and she isn't the type to do that.

No, I'm concerned because Husband has not told Friend that he and I are separated, and he deliberately implied that I would be at his house all week. He has asked me to stay at the house over spring break so that Friend and Child will not be alone all week while he is at work. I felt pressured to say yes.

I want to tell him that this is not something I can do. I feel like I would be an asshole because I'd be letting Friend down, but I need time to myself without Child breathing down my neck and insisting on being entertained. I am not being paid to babysit, nor is the draw of seeing my dog again worth the trouble of not having any alone time for an entire week that is supposed to be relaxing for me.

Would I be the asshole if I told him this?

UPDATE:  Well this was a wakeup call and a half.  Getting my stuff this weekend and cutting the cord.  I’m also separating our finances.

I (28f) and husband (30M) do not have kids. We both have decent paying jobs and a real estate. That said we love to travel and many times also pay & invite our families to go with us.
My brother (26M) married and had my nephew (4m) with my middle school best friend (28F). Yes, he married my best friend and we are still best friends. They had my nephew and years later divorced.

To the Point: My brother started dating his new GF we will call her Ashley. They’ve been together for around 9 ish months. They’re not engaged or married. She has a son who is 5, we will call him John. I’ve only met John a handful of times. He’s a nice kid but I don’t really know him. I only know Ashley on an first name basis in a way. We talk occasionally but nothing in depth.

I invited my ex SIL& nephew to Disney this summer for 6 days. 2 days in Disney, 1 in Universal. The remaining days would be chill/Orlando days.
We are paying for them to go. I’ve always wanted to take nephew to Disney since he was smaller. He loves Mickey! We didn’t tell him in front of John or Ashley. 
But it made it back to Ashley that we are taking him. She confronts me at a family dinner on the side& tells me she’s upset we are not including her child and that he should have been invited. She said he doesn’t feel like he fits in/ is family and that is excluding him from Disney has made him cry all night. I was so shocked.

We are easily paying $2k for my nephew & best friend to go. Tickets, airfare, lodging, and of course some toys. 

I blew up. I told her that I didn’t even know her or her kid. They have only been around for a few months & he’s not my nephew. I told her I didn’t like the entitled mentality and to make it a point I would make sure to exclude her from all future family gatherings. She left crying. My brother and parents are all upset with me. That I’m excluding this child& isolated them. I told them if they’d like to pay for them I don’t mind them tagging along but they all said “You have more means than us”. They’re not doing great financially which is why I didn’t ask in the beginning. She made a huge FB post and everyone is siding with her. 

Did I go too far? Should I have offered to include them? AITA?

I (26F) lost my dad last November. My mom (54) took it really hard. She’s extremely depressed and can’t do anything pretty much. She’s suffering from anxiety, addiction and possibly bipolar disorder (she does not wanna get that official from her psychiatrist). She also doesn’t want to go to therapy, doesn’t believe in it. I recommended her some people but she refused. Now whenever I’m mentioning grief counseling or psychologist she just get mad at me and start yelling or hang up.

One night not in your bed would not have killed you princess",-17,0,900,900,"A family friend was getting married nearby to me, so my sister asked if she and my nephews could stay with me because hotel rooms in the area are expensive. The house I am currently living in I bought a few months ago. I barely have any furniture in it and don't plan on buying anymore for a while because I plan on renovating and don't want it in the way. The only things to sleep on is my bed and a couch.

 I told my sister that. She said it was okay and that she would bring an air mattress for her sons to sleep on and she would sleep on the couch. I also told her that the couch was really small (loveseat sized) and uncomfortable. She said it would be fine for one night. I also told her to bring their own bedding because I really don't have much aside from what I use.

The night of the wedding my sister's son's are tired so they leave the reception early around 9pm. I wanted to stay longer so I told her would get a ride home from someone else and gave her the keys to my house.

When I get home around midnight my sister is watching tv in the living room. Her son's aren't there. She explains to me that her air mattress wouldn't inflate. so she put her son's in my bed and said since my bed is big enough she could share with them and I could sleep on the couch.

I said that wasn't happening. The couch is way to uncomfortable to sleep on and way too short for me. I would be hanging off the end. I already have enough trouble sleeping and I had stuff I needed to do the next day. I tried to get the air mattress the work, but it wouldn't turn on. So I got my spare blanket and set it up on the floor along with a sleeping bag. My sister reluctantly got the boys up and off my bed. Once they were all in their spots I went to bed and quickly fell asleep.

The next morning my sister was in a really bad mood. They all didn't sleep the whole night because the blankets I set up on the ground weren't thick enough and it was uncomfortable. My sister tried sleeping on the floor, but her son's fought about sleeping on the couch because there wasn't room enough for the both of them.

I had to beg him to do a paternity test and he finally agreed after a month, and it proved that I didn't cheat. We had been together since we were 13 so I was devastated and all I wanted was him back, but I've come to my senses and decided that someone who believes that school level punnet squares are the be all and end all of biological inheritance is not the type of person I wanna be with. I was also treated like crap by everyone but my older brother, Alex, while we were waiting for the results because they all thought I had cheated. It was a horrible experience and as a result, I've lost many friends and family members. 

Since the results came back, my ex has been begging me to get back with him. I moved in with Alex after we split, and he comes almost everyday to beg me to get back with him. My in laws have also been harassing me too, especially my MIL who has come over four times in the past week asking me to forgive her son and to 'let God back into my heart'. I used to be a Christian and so are all my in laws and my family, but how I was treated when my baby was born made me lose faith fast.

Yesterday, my MIL turned up to Alex's when he wasn't here, and she had the pastor from the church I used to attend with them. They practically forced their way in, and I was being berated like a child for not forgiving my ex's 'lapse in judgement'. The pastor basically sat there and said I would be going to hell if I didn't take my ex back. I excused myself to use the bathroom, and called the police. Pastor and MIL were escorted out. 

Now, I'm being harassed on social media and being called and texted by literally everyone that knows both me and my ex and his family. They're calling me the AH for going nuclear and calling the police on two people who weren't being threatening and they're demanding that I apologise immediately. I'm starting to feel bad now because I know they care in their own twisted way and I shouldn't have gone nuclear on them. AITA?",8881,"LiveLovelyLala","gingernutbiscuitss",0
"What are your personal recommendations for dealing with a 10 hour flight?","Frequent flyer here who has done multiple long haul transcontinental flights:

* Get up and stretch regularly, sitting for that long is bad for circulation and is tiring and draining in its own way.

* Bring over the counter pain relief, decongestant, and antihistimine in case something triggers a headache, sinus problems, or an allergy etc.

* Track suits are very comfortable, bring layers so you can adapt to the situation. It's nice to have inside pockets or zipper pockets.

* Eye mask and ear plugs, and a neck pillow

* Drink water regularly but slowly

* Have spare earphones if you like listening to things. 

* Break up the time between playing games, watching a movie, tv, and reading, by breaking it up the time goes by a lot faster.  Playing calm word games or sudoku are great if you are trying to relax and fall asleep.

* Comfortable shoes and socks that allow your feet to swell.  Being at that high altitude for a long time causes some swelling.",1,0,13,13,"",13,"myhydrogendioxide","thebirdman619",0

To the Point: My brother started dating his new GF we will call her Ashley. They’ve been together for around 9 ish months. They’re not engaged or married. She has a son who is 5, we will call him John. I’ve only met John a handful of times. He’s a nice kid but I don’t really know him. I only know Ashley on an first name basis in a way. We talk occasionally but nothing in depth.

I invited my ex SIL& nephew to Disney this summer for 6 days. 2 days in Disney, 1 in Universal. The remaining days would be chill/Orlando days.
We are paying for them to go. I’ve always wanted to take nephew to Disney since he was smaller. He loves Mickey! We didn’t tell him in front of John or Ashley. 
But it made it back to Ashley that we are taking him. She confronts me at a family dinner on the side& tells me she’s upset we are not including her child and that he should have been invited. She said he doesn’t feel like he fits in/ is family and that is excluding him from Disney has made him cry all night. I was so shocked.

We are easily paying $2k for my nephew & best friend to go. Tickets, airfare, lodging, and of course some toys.

She talks about how since our dog ""Ricky"" has past away, all she wants to do with my dad is travel, which would leave no room for Spot and all of the requirements he needs.

So I got a domain and set up a help desk. Then I told my family that if they wanted any help from me, they should go to the website and submit a ticket for my help. My aunt said I was being ridiculous, but I was deadly serious.

He came out to the kitchen complaining, and I told him to wear this tee I got for his birthday last month. I told him the pattern had some pink in it and would match well with pink jeans.

Caden immediately started yelling and kicking off. He insisted that they weren’t pink, and accused me of gaslighting him. He said they were red and I just had an agenda of masculating him. These jeans are literally rose pink, so I was definitely not gaslighting him.

He called our mom at work (this was during her lunch hour) and told her what I said. My mom took Caden’s side and accused me of raining on my brothers parade by making him feel bad about his new clothes. I replied that I don’t think guys wearing pink is bad, and Caden is just making drama over nothing.

Now Caden won’t wear the jeans, and because they aren’t returnable, my mom wants me to reimburse him the cost of the jeans. There’s no way I’m doing that.

Look, he's grown and needs to make his own decisions and mistakes. If this does blow up on him, he's going to need his brother's support to heal. If you're unavailable to him because you can't let go of your disapproval, you've lost status as a safe, supportive, loving brother he can turn to when he needs. 

If you care about him as much as you say you do, then apologize and tell him you love him and will support him in his choices.",0,0,64,64,"Hi guys, new account since my brother knows my main and I don't want him to maybe look at my posting history and seeing me on here. 

I (30m) and my brother (25m) have stopped speaking over me not approving of him and his partner (45m) and their plans to move across the state. I'll call my brother D and his partner A from now on.

A and D have been dating for three, maybe four months. A... Not only is he older, he's weird. He's very cold and quiet, super reserved, like the exact opposite of my really friendly and outgoing brother. He's got a serious job while D is just a bartender, he doesn't like partying and clubbing like D does, he doesn't seem to have any of his own friends. 

They've become super close in a really short period of time, my brother made it clear they were living together after about two months. I didn't get on with A right away. Our mom likes him ok but she just wants D to be happy. I can't help but think it's super weird that this guy came out of nowhere and now the two of them are inseparable. They haven't been apart since they met as far as I can tell. 

And then D announced their plans to move from our hometown to a city on the other side of the state. I knew D hated it here but this jump sounds crazy to me, especially after how little they've known each other. I told D about this and how much I don't like A, and he basically told me A had to move for work, I needed to mind my own business, and I'm just looking for excuses to break them up.  

I don't doubt that D is serious about A, but the way he talks about him is nuts, he keeps talking about how no one has ever understood him this much and they're soulmates. A is just as bad. I feel like the relationship is going to blow up in their faces and then my brother is going to be stranded in a city with basically a stranger. But when I tried to explain this, (and I'll admit I lost my temper but I couldn't believe how stupid my brother is being) we fought and stopped talking. I told him to his face the whole soulmates thing is crap and he's being naive. My mom just thinks we need to let things run their course since D is so unhappy in our hometown and he needs to figure stuff out. I think she doesn't see how dangerous this could be. No A hasn't done anything scary now but he definitely could and I don't know why no one else is taking this seriously. D's friends mostly live out of our hometown too and are just happy for him to move  closer to them, but they don't seem to care about A.

The house I am currently living in I bought a few months ago. I barely have any furniture in it and don't plan on buying anymore for a while because I plan on renovating and don't want it in the way. The only things to sleep on is my bed and a couch.

 I told my sister that. She said it was okay and that she would bring an air mattress for her sons to sleep on and she would sleep on the couch. I also told her that the couch was really small (loveseat sized) and uncomfortable. She said it would be fine for one night. I also told her to bring their own bedding because I really don't have much aside from what I use.

The night of the wedding my sister's son's are tired so they leave the reception early around 9pm. I wanted to stay longer so I told her would get a ride home from someone else and gave her the keys to my house.

When I get home around midnight my sister is watching tv in the living room. Her son's aren't there. She explains to me that her air mattress wouldn't inflate. so she put her son's in my bed and said since my bed is big enough she could share with them and I could sleep on the couch.

I said that wasn't happening. The couch is way to uncomfortable to sleep on and way too short for me. I would be hanging off the end. I already have enough trouble sleeping and I had stuff I needed to do the next day. I tried to get the air mattress the work, but it wouldn't turn on. So I got my spare blanket and set it up on the floor along with a sleeping bag. My sister reluctantly got the boys up and off my bed. Once they were all in their spots I went to bed and quickly fell asleep.

The next morning my sister was in a really bad mood. They all didn't sleep the whole night because the blankets I set up on the ground weren't thick enough and it was uncomfortable. My sister tried sleeping on the floor, but her son's fought about sleeping on the couch because there wasn't room enough for the both of them. My sister said I could have at least checked up on them or let the boys sleep in my bed with me, but to me that's really weird and I would not have been comfortable with that.

When I was an adolescent she moved halfway across the globe to give me a better chance at life so I have always felt indebted to her. However, she is incredibly controlling and at times even selfish. 

She has never wanted me to have a boyfriend (shamed my the boyfriend that I introduced to her for not being wealthy and asked me to break up with him for it, even though we aren’t either). She is also judgmental about the way I look, and about how much I spend on clothes (which is admittedly a lot but it is something that makes me happy, and I do it with my own money). 

A year ago, I got a job across the country that paid really well, and was able to move out. After 2 months of separate housing, she threw a massive fit, and said I am soulless and unloving for wanting to continue living on my own. That she feels unsafe alone. This is after we bought a house in our original city together that I agreed to continue paying the hoa fees for even after moving out. I gave in and had her move in with me. 

Now I am in a situation where I pay for the housing and bills and everything and she lives with me and doesn’t work. She however cooks and takes care of the house which I’m very grateful for. I would be totally fine with all this if she was willing to compromise with me even the slightest bit. 

I recently had a birthday, and she wanted me to plan something for it. So I set up a dinner out which we had with a few of our friends. It was a beautiful night; I had the best time. During planning this, we found out that one of our friends would be unable to make it to the dinner, so I was going to do something with her separately, and I had begged my mom to not invite people over to our house. I work long hours and we have a puppy. When we have people over, my mother hates that the puppy gets excited so she puts him on a leash and has me hold him the whole time. This makes it difficult for me and him both. 

I came home tonight at 8 pm to the news that we were going to have a birthday dinner in our house within 30 minutes. There were only 2 guests, but I was already exhausted and now roped into something that I explicitly asked to not happen. 

Low and behold, I was miserable the whole time. I was constantly on hold-the-dog duty while being tired and dealing with cramps. I just wanted these people to leave and there they were talking about manicures and Spain. By the time that they left (after 11 pm) I had been secretly glaring daggers at them and my mom for hours. I tried to act nice, didn’t say a rude thing, but was also not very into the conversation, and when they said they should leave, I didn’t contradict them. My mother thinks I am the asshole for not being happy that she cooked and planned a second birthday dinner for me.

So when I messaged my family introducing my son with his name - Oliver, the general response was positive- however my brother and his wife (both nearly 40) sent me a nasty text and wouldn’t speak to me. I didn’t understand why as it was a short message and didn’t explain anything- just that they were angry about his name. Since they wouldn’t speak to me I rang my sister.

Nigel was a widower of three years when he met my sister. His kids at the time of them meeting were 6f and 8m. Nigel's late wife's family was around a lot. My sister hated it. From the very early days it was clear she was toxically jealous of Nigel's late wife and the kids mom. She talked about how strange it was the kids, who didn't remember her, had her photo in their bedrooms, how her stepdaughter had a locket with a photo of her mom, dad and brother in it. I remember back then asking how it was strange. Her mom was loved and Nigel and his late wife's family likely didn't want the kids to not know they were loved by their mom. She said that was her job now. I told her it wasn't healthy to feel that jealous and put out over a mom being remembered. Think of how she would feel if our mom died.

Honestly, I had a lot of respect for Nigel for the first two or three years because his kids seemed to be his priority and he seemed to still love and care about his late wife and not want to erase her but was also ready to be married to someone else. I had seen a lot of far more awful scenarios. But then he started letting my sister push herself onto the kids and try to force out their maternal relatives. It was very clear my sister blamed the maternal relatives for neither of her stepkids coming to think of her as their mom. She didn't want to hear any other reason it could be.

Now both of her stepkids are adults and her stepson became a father for the first time in January. His daughter is named after both her grandmother's. But his mom's name is her first name. My sister was so unhappy about that. She told him it was disrespectful to her and all that crap. He told her to go fuck herself and told her she still hadn't figured out that she wasn't his mom, she wasn't his parent, she wasn't even his real family, because he would happily dump her out of his life for good and would never feel bad about that.

My sister bitched for weeks about it and then I told her if I was her stepkid, I'd do the same. That she had no respect for his mom and had no respect for his maternal family. She freaked out and told me that was a shitty thing to say and I should be on HER side, because she's my SISTER.

My niece and nephew are usually nice, but they can be really difficult sometimes (just like all kids i assume).

My sister asked me why, since I'm home all week with no plans anyways. She had asked me if I had plans for that week before asking me to babysit. If she had just asked me to babysit first, I would've lied and said I have plans. I tried to explain that I don't really know anything about kids or how to deal with them, but she got mad at me and called me selfish.

NTA",1,0,1135,1135,"Me (19F) and my soon-to-be husband (21M) got engaged after 4 years together.

I was really young when we first started dating and the nagging of my MIL, wanting us to have kids early, always bothered me. I took my complaints to my fiancé but he dismissed me saying that i should ""understand his mother's ways"". I didn't get her hopes up about me having kids, because i always said that i wanted to mature enough to be able to raise a kid.

As i said, i just dismissed her nagging, until last week.

My fiancé came home from work (that btw he works with his mother), saying: ""I was with mom all that in the office,and after she told me some things i came to the conclusion that you should stop taking your birth control pills"". Unbelievable. Didn't even want to argue about something this ridiculous.

Time passed and we didn't touch this issue anymore.

The weekend came, and we went to visit my MIL's house, she took me to her room saying she needed to have a word with me and my fiancé.

She sat down on the bed and said: ""I had a discussion with Luiz (my fiancé's name), and i told him about my concern with you guys not having children at the appropriate age. Who knows if you're going to be able to have children with this disease of yours? As for now, he will no longer allow you to buy the birth control pills per my request""

(He never buyed them for me, i work 9 hours a day and everything i buy for myself comes from my money)

About ""my disease"": It's a disease that all the women in my father's side had: Uterus Cancer. My great-great-grandmother passed due to it, my great-grandmother too and my grandma had it after giving birth to my father, but the doctors took the uterus out before the cancer could spread further. My grandma was always cautious with me. Never had any issues, and i go to the gynecologist 2 times a year to do exams.

 I got enraged, and looked at my fiancé who was sitting beside her, and he just averted his eyes.

""you will regret leaving the thoughts of having kids after your graduation, because god time is now and i got a revelation from the pastor that one of my family members is going to try to have kids and it's not gonna be able to. I'm sure that person is you, and i'm worried for my son. I can't leave this marriage be if your thoughts don't align.""

When she said that last line, i exploded, saying ""Are you so desperate for me to sit on your son's cock and have a baby so what? It's not your business if we're having kids or not or if we're having sex or not, this must be a joke"".

The argument escalated but i don't remember much because i got so enraged that i started trembling and had to go home to calm myself down alone, as i left my fiancé there.

When he came home, he was pissed off saying that i disrespected his mother and that if i didn't apologise he would consider breaking off the engagement. Honestly am not making any effort to set things straight as i'm very offended by everything she said.

Now that she’s stated you aren’t her family it’s time you stop doing things for her that you would for family. This doesn’t apply to your husband but to you and your kids.

NTA",5,0,2874,2874,"My husband and I have three biological children together, he adopted my child from a prior relationship and I am a stepmother to his adult child. My husband was divorced from my stepdaughter's mom. She was 8 when my husband and I became serious and my son was still a baby. Not long after my stepdaughter's mom died. My husband and I had talked about marrying before she died and we delayed it for a couple of years to allow my stepdaughter time to grieve and adjust to the changes in her life. This was with the help of therapy, of course. We knew a child who lost someone so close would need extra help.

Now my stepdaughter is 20, my son is 12 and our children together are 7, 6 and 4.

So what happened here is my stepdaughter and her boyfriend recently moved into a house together. She asked for help setting up their dining room and we all went over to help her. Her house was covered in photos. The landing had them, living room, kitchen, etc. There was not a single photo of her siblings in the house, or me, but it was not seeing one of the kids that led to this. She had her parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, her cousins, and friends. But there was no sign of the kids anywhere. All of the photos with her dad were older ones, from before we met. My 12 year old, 7 and 6 year old's noticed because they were excited to look around her house. I couldn't help but notice because her boyfriend had so many of his siblings and because there were some, what felt like deliberate choices, to make sure she used photos that didn't contain her siblings. Including extended family photos from years ago with my husband's side that were taken before her dad and I met. And we know she has photos with her siblings.

I always knew she wasn't super crazy about her siblings. I always hoped as she got older she would feel love for them. But it feels like she doesn't think of them as family or as special enough to be included. The three kids who noticed were hurt. My husband tried to assure them it was likely an oversight on her part and he called her the next day to ask. She said she had only wanted photos with people she considered family and she didn't consider us family.

We were all invited to her housewarming party. But the kids did not want to go. My husband and ILs were shocked and said they had to go of course. I argued that they didn't and I told him I would stay home with them. They argued back to me that the kids needed to be. I said they did not need to be there and I wouldn't force them to go when they already feel hurt. My husband and ILs think I'm unreasonable.

I'm on vacation with my (36) family and sister (32) and my sister and I have been arguing almost every day. And if we aren't arguing, she's ignoring me. She gets upset when I stand up for myself when my father is acting unreasonable. For example, we would be trying to find the correct exit from the subway and we will say Exit C and he think it's Exit A. Before we can confirm the correct one, he will walk towards his own Exit or start to become frustrated that no one is listening to him.  Sometimes we follow him to placate him but when he's wrong, he blames everyone saying ""well I knew which Exit to get to the street but I don't know the address of where we're going so you guys were supposed to tell me!"" If any of choose a separate Exit, we better be 100% correct because if we get lost,  he makes smug faces like we're so stupid or he will actually say out loud that we're dumb and actively not help. It's been so frustrating so I admit that a couple of times, I would point out that he's throwing a tantrum and he would get even more upset and I would be sarcastic and say, ""oh no we're lost, it's such a big deal... ooohh... the world is ending. Whatever. It's not a big deal why are you acting this way"". So this is where my sister and I started arguing every day. She says that if I know my father is upset already, then why can't I just ignore him and understand where he's coming from. That I need to be grateful for everything they've sacrificed for me. And that I'm a spoiled brat who refuses to see their side. And that everything I say is just stuff I learned from tiktok and woke media. But I think it's so fucking rude and disrespectful. He constantly belittles me, calling us stupid for making small mistakes. I told him I hate gondola rides and they scare me but he will actively go out of his way to rock the gondola and scare me even more. When I question him, he gets defensive and escalates into yelling and my mom and sis usually get quiet. But I'm the one who always says no. Enough is enough. You need to stop. But they don't support me. They both come at me and tell me I need to grow up, stop egging my father on, and stop throwing tantrums. But my ""tantrums"" are when I'm emotionally overwhelmed and tell them I need space and walk away. One day she wasnt talking, when I asked why she said ""I don't want to talk to you because every time we talk, we argue. So I don't want to answer you."" And just ignored me all morning. I'm so tired of this, I got a hotel room for myself for one night to reset. And the voice messages and texts I got from my family were so manipulative. Especially from my sister. I don't want to spend another 7 days with them.  I woke up this morning and am already dreading seeing them. AITA for wanting to be alone for the rest of the trip?",4,"ToastMmmmmmm","burner483000",0

"AITA for telling my sister if she was my stepmom I wouldn't name my kid after her either?","NTA. Why hasn’t Nigel left her yet? Ugh!",1,0,4650,4650,"My sister has been married to her husband Nigel for 21 years and they have been together for about 23 years. Nigel was a widower of three years when he met my sister. His kids at the time of them meeting were 6f and 8m. Nigel's late wife's family was around a lot. My sister hated it. From the very early days it was clear she was toxically jealous of Nigel's late wife and the kids mom. She talked about how strange it was the kids, who didn't remember her, had her photo in their bedrooms, how her stepdaughter had a locket with a photo of her mom, dad and brother in it. I remember back then asking how it was strange. Her mom was loved and Nigel and his late wife's family likely didn't want the kids to not know they were loved by their mom. She said that was her job now. I told her it wasn't healthy to feel that jealous and put out over a mom being remembered. Think of how she would feel if our mom died.

Honestly, I had a lot of respect for Nigel for the first two or three years because his kids seemed to be his priority and he seemed to still love and care about his late wife and not want to erase her but was also ready to be married to someone else. I had seen a lot of far more awful scenarios. But then he started letting my sister push herself onto the kids and try to force out their maternal relatives. It was very clear my sister blamed the maternal relatives for neither of her stepkids coming to think of her as their mom. She didn't want to hear any other reason it could be.

Now both of her stepkids are adults and her stepson became a father for the first time in January. His daughter is named after both her grandmother's. But his mom's name is her first name. My sister was so unhappy about that. She told him it was disrespectful to her and all that crap. He told her to go fuck herself and told her she still hadn't figured out that she wasn't his mom, she wasn't his parent, she wasn't even his real family, because he would happily dump her out of his life for good and would never feel bad about that.

My sister bitched for weeks about it and then I told her if I was her stepkid, I'd do the same. That she had no respect for his mom and had no respect for his maternal family. She freaked out and told me that was a shitty thing to say and I should be on HER side, because she's my SISTER.

But the biggest disagreement we've had so far is about her boyfriend (37M). They've only been dating for a few months, and I don't feel comfortable having him at my wedding. It's a small affair, and we only invited people who we are close with and who have been a part of our lives for a long time. We didn't want to invite any strangers or people we barely know.

I calmly explained my concerns, but I told her I wouldn't compromise on this. It's my wedding day, and I want to be surrounded by people who I love and who have been there for me throughout my life.

Lily is a bully. I have met her a handful of times and she is always making fun of Eni, who is a little fat, Lily's always telling that bad pig jokes and she even gave Eni a nickname, Pigni.
I have complained to Tom and Tom's mom that Lily's jokes weren't funny and she should stop, but they always said she was just joking. I told Eni that she should return the jokes to Lily, but she can never think of anything to say.
Last year I was invited to Tom's family's Christmas party, everything was fine until Lily said something like ""Oh God Eni, you've already eaten so much, at this pace you'll stop being Pigni to become Whalni"" and she laugh with the children at the party. I was furious and Eni and Tom gave a fake laugh and said that Eni was 4 months pregnant. When we were all congratulating them, Lily said ""wow, at least now you can excuse yourself when people see you eating like a pig."" I got furious again but Eni asked me to just let it go but I know how much that jokes hurt her. So I went back to having a talk with Tom and his mother about why Lily's teasing had to stop.
 Well, this weekend was Eni's babyshower, we were having a good time until Lily told another joke about how ""fat"" Eni had gotten, I had enough so I laughed so loud to attract attention and said ""Oh Lily, you're so funny, especially when you finish your jokes with that ugly pig laugh, sometimes I think people laugh more at your laugh than at your joke."" Lily got super serious and she told me it wasn't funny, to which I said ""come on, it's a joke"" and imitated her laugh, the kids at the party laughed too and Lily ran away while she cried. Tom's mother scolded me for the joke and I asked her why Lily's jokes were funny but mine weren't, if they both had a pig joke in it, and her mother couldn't answer me. I told her that every time I heard Lily tell a joke about Eni, I would return the joke.

I don't get it. It sounds like teenager problems with adult budgets.
For the time being, I'm going with YTA for making an issue of something that is a non-issue, but feel free to give more information that can explain what the issue is.",1,0,4,4,"My sister and I have paid (half and half) for a week long vacation for my mom, dad, and myself. It's for my mom's birthday last year but we arranged it in advance.

We paid for a vacation home that houses 6 people though we're 4 in total.

So my sister is bringing her boyfriend. I'm OK with this. I actually expected it.

I asked to bring a friend, and they were apprehensive about answering directly so I read the room and assumed they wouldn't be OK with it. But what they said was that it was about mom, not whether I'd be bored (I also followed this up by asking if I had a girlfriend would they let me bring her, and they said yes. That privately annoyed me but I didn't chase them on this or argue).

I later suggested maybe it's best if I don't go with them - that way I've still paid for half of it I just won't be with them for the vacation. But again they don't want with this because mom will feel happier if I'm there for her birthday present. So I dropped it.

We've still got more than a month until we go. Currently, according to them I'm going along with them and not bringing anyone with me. WIBTA if I dropped out or tried to convince them I could bring a friend? I've already paid for it and I'm OK with that

EDIT as peolpe have asked for info. I am thinking selfishly because I don't like being with them and I want to avoid boredom. Does the motivation make me an AH? Even if I went and didn't bring a friend, would my motivation still make me an AH?",4,"kjermy","holidaythrowaway__90",0

If you want to have a party but don't want to foot the bill for booze then give your guests the option to BYOB but don't charge them FFS its so low class!",1,0,6647,6647,"This past weekend my wife (41F) I (42M) attended one of my friends party's that I was invited to. For context my friend (42M) his gf (48F) and their two friends (also mid 40's M&F) were hosting this party the **4 of them together.**

A few weeks ago when I received the invitation I realized that it said on it something along the lines of ""please be prepared to purchase your own drinks"". Didn't think much of it at the time considering I just thought they were hiring a bar tender or something, but fast forward to the day of the party.

I arrive with my wife and it's my friend and his gf standing behind their kitchen counter that they were using as their ""bar"", making/charging the guests for drinks. Now I was confused for a few reasons...

1, the fact that this party was held at my friends house, it's not like this was at an event space or something where this would be normal imo. 2, there was no bar tender that they hired or anything like that. It was literally 2 of the 4 of them standing in the kitchen at a time making drinks for people and then charging them accordingly (drinks were all under $10).

Now idk if this is actually a common thing, but I have never in my 42 years of living been to a ""party"" at a friends house where the hosts are charging you themselves for drinks.

I've had multiple parties over the years, that I have invited my friend and his gf to in which they have attended, and I've never charged **ANYONE** for drinks ever. I've always bought all the drinks myself and had an open bar type of situation. Where my guests can make there own drinks. I even had a proper bar tender once and still no one was charged, it was an open bar.

I honestly felt like my friend, his gf and their friends were all trying to make a quick buck off of their guests who attended. Clearly to cover to cost of the drinks. Which yeah I understand that booze isn't cheap these days but we're talking splitting the cost of whatever they bought between **4 PEOPLE**. Like in my opinion if you can't afford to supply drinks at your party, why are you having a party in the first place?

This also wasn't for charity or anything the money made off of the drinks was for them to split.

My wife and I bought one drink each, stayed for about an hour or so, and said our goodbyes. When we were leaving my friend asked why we didn't have that much to drink? I told him because I think it's ridiculous that they are charging their close friends for drinks. He called me cheap and an unsupportive friend. I assured him that i'm not, if the charging of drinks was for a good cause (like profits go to charity or something) of course i'd buy drinks.

I told him I find the fact that they are charging for drinks, and keeping the money for themselves ridiculous and taking advantage of their friends. Anyway now my friend and his gf are butt hurt about this and have been calling me an AH to our mutual friends. AITA here?

(EDIT: Wow! I did not expect this post to blow up like this but thank you guys.

SIL is Sophie, she’s 26F and married to my husband’s brother. I’m 29F.

Sophie has been married to my BIL since late 2021. Whenever we have had holidays she has spent it with her family, and my husband and I only go back to his hometown during the holidays - so I don’t know her well.

Anyway we have a holiday coming up in just over a month. For the first time Sophie’s parents will be away so she will be celebrating with us.

That’s all background. As is the fact that my MIL is a trained patissier. I promise it’s relevant.

I happened to be in town this week and MIL started putting together her list of ingredients for the stuff she will make. She was consulting me, and my husband’s sister Zara, about what to make and also delegated a couple of things to each of us.

Sophie came into the living room and said “oh I can definitely make better brownies, tartlets and whatever else than [my name]!”

Now my MIL takes desserts very seriously. I said okay you can make that stuff but MIL said no we need to have the nicest sweets. There was a back and forth and Sophie suggested what I can only describe as a bake off.

So we made brownies, tiramisu, lemon meringue and the family judged between us and everyone voted in my favour. 

Sophie got mad at me and said I’d hidden the fact that I know how to bake from her to which Zara said neither of us really bake when MIL is around because she’s amazing but that we both *can* if we need to.

Now Sophie is mad at me for both hiding my ability from her and for purposefully embarrassing her in front of our in laws. I think she’s stupid - she wanted the silly bake off right up until she lost, it’s not my fault she has an ego

"AITA for suggesting my stepson (16M) moves out?","YTA What happened with your SDs came about organically. Sounds like they figured it out themselves and so they're both happy. What you're doing/have done is because you feel it's unfair that your son doesn't have his 'own room'. That's not your stepson's fault and not his job/responsibility to fix. You can pretty it all up with word salad to make it seem like you're looking out for everyone but you said it yourself. 'It's unfair that all the older kids but my son have their own rooms at one of their parents house.' 

Oh and look! That would also probably get rid of that close bond that your husband and his oldest son have at the same time! Woohoo!!! Two birds and all that. ",80,0,2864,2864,"My husband and I have 6 children total and live in 4 bedroom house. We have two sons together (8 & 6), I have a son from a previous relationship (15), and I have 3 step children (20F, 16M & 16F). We live in a 4 bedroom house and for most the time we lived there we had 2 kids per room with the youngest boys sharing, the older boys sharing and the girls sharing. 

Things changed a couple years ago. My oldest stepdaughter finished school and is attending university locally. The girls decided at this point that instead of sharing a bedroom at their dads and sharing a bedroom at their mums, they would each take 1 room as their permanent bedroom. So the 16 yr old lives with us full time and the 20 yr old lives with her mum full time. They both visit the other parents house regularly. 

My 16 yr old stepson has his own bedroom at his mum's house but still splits time between each parents house mostly 50/50. My son lives full time with us as he doesn't have much of a relationship with his dad. My son and stepson do not get on that well and they can often be heard screaming at each other in their bedroom. 

Recently, I asked my stepson why he doesn't move to live full time with his mum so he and my son can have a similar arrangement as their sisters. This way both of the boys would have their own rooms. He would obviously still visit like his older sister does and we could figure something out like a futon instead of a bed in their room so my son has more space when stepson's not there. 

My stepson overreacted to my suggestion and is trying to make out like I'm kicking him out, when really I'm just thinking of a better use of space. It's unfair that all the older kids but my son have their own rooms at one of their parents house. My son likes the idea and has brought it up to his stepbrother a few more times since I originally suggested it and it has caused arguments between them. He now seems to be considering it. 

My husband is angry with me for suggesting his son moving permanently to his mums. He thinks that he and his son would have a less close relationship if this happens (my husband favours his oldest son over our boys).

Tell him to seek a girlfriend with hyperovulation to increase his chances. ",3,0,2435,2435,"I (23f) come from a family with a large amount of twins (i know, how very reddit). Ive always heard from family that apparently its hereditary. I always thought it was bullshit untill i did a bit of research and found out that fraternal twin can be hereditary but only really for women and from the mothers side.

My brother (20m) seems to have clung on to that and thinks he will have twins when he has kids. He seems weirdly proud of it (idk why, having twins sounds like a nightmare). He was talking about it recently and i told him that its likely he will never have twins since its only really hereditry for women. 

He took offence to that and had a little fit. My mum seems to think i should of kept my mouth shut and not ""burst his bubble"". AITA",2435,"Kanulie","DefinitionBulky7630",1

And who even ask strangers WHY they buy product xy?! That is not of your concern, lady! What was her gameplan if OP says ""yes"" to having a baby? Butching about the restocking police of the store?

So I was at the grocery store the other day. On the way there I ran through a tree but that’s a story for another day.
So I was at the grocery store right, and I was restocking my skincare products with 2 bottles of baby wash and 2 tubs of baby cream. This lady behind me asks me if I have a baby. I was raised well so I was honest and said no these are for me. She then proceeded to scold me saying those products are for babies only and me using them makes parents miss out on products they use for their babies. She told me how last week she was out of baby wash and rushed to the store only to find the baby products out of stock. 
I said no sorry but she got upset and told me I didn’t understand.

"AITA for getting upset when my boyfriend talks badly about my family?","NTA.

""He's amazing at everything else"", except for the parts where he insisted your family sucks despite you improving your relationship with them (even though family is important) and your self-started successful business which he wants you to abandon because it isn't that important.

Yeah, sounds like a real prize. ",3,0,2,2,"Backstory: My (25F) boyfriend (26M) currently have a long distance relationship. We met back in high-school and started dating about 6months ago. He lost his job a month ago and I have a business that I can't move. We have been discussing who will be the one to move and yesterday after weighing all options put my foot down and said that I can't be the one that moves because of my business. There isn't nearly as much for me to do with my business where he lives compared to where I live. It doesn't make sense to move and he can do his same job anywhere. 

Now to the family part. He and his family have always been close whereas my family wasn't always the best and we had a falling out for about a year and just regained contact about 9months ago and things are going good so far and I'm happy. My boyfriend however keeps saying that his family is better than mine and gets upset when I defend my family because he feels they don't deserve it. He said he worries about our future children being around them (I'm not even pregnant) and said they don't compare to his family. He has only met my patents once for a few hours and they were nothing but kind to him. I express to him that what he is saying is hurting me but he feels it needs to be discussed because one of us has to move and family is a factor and he's just being logical and then just keeps repeating everything that upset me right after I told him it upset me. I understand needing to talk about it but I feel there is a better way to talk about a sensitive topic than the harsh and abrasive way he is. 

He also devalued my business that I'm super successful in and wants me to just throw away 3.5years of hard work and attempt to rebuild it where he lives if I even can or just get another job because ""my job is not that difficult and I don't even need a degree for it and it's just a job."" My job isn't just a job to me. I feel he should be more supportive of me and my decision to reconnect with my family rather than constantly bringing it down when he wasn't even there for the bad parts. And I feel he should be proud of me for the business I built and how successful I am. He also called me selfish and closed minded for saying I won't leave my business.
