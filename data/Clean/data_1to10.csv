"AITA for suing my parents for my college money.","NTA- your parents stole from you. You have every right to do what needs to be done to get that money back.",1,0,3454,3454,"My great-aunt set up savings accounts for all of her female relatives. In our culture education for women is not really valued and she thought that was bullshit. 

She lived with her father in London where she was educated. She went on to attend university and became a doctor  She married a British man, they moved to America and had a great life. She funded the education of as many of her neices and grand neices as she could. 

When she passed away she left money for every girl relative she could. 

My parents managed to access the accounts that were set up for my sister and I. They used it to pay for my brother's wedding. My sister didn't care because she got married two years out of high school and had no intention of going to college. 

When I graduated I went to the bank to get money for school and it was almost all gone.  There was like $13,000 left. 

I asked my parents about it and they said they had needed the money. I finally found out where the money went. I got furious. I got student loans and moved out. I am a great source of shame to them and I don't give two fucks. 

I am currently suing them for the money that was left for me. My entire family is against me. They all think I am a complete asshole for airing private family business in public. And that I am putting money ahead of family. My friends are all on my side but they are all Americans and don't really get my culture.  Neither do I to be honest. 

My brother called me up and offered to pay for my university if I drop the lawsuit. I agreed as long as we had a legally binding contract. He said I was being an asshole for not trusting him. I said he should not have accepted my money for his wedding. It is causing all kinds of embarrassment in our community.

"AITA for ditching my friend and her toddler at a restaurant because they were late?","NTA. Your friend is an entitled AH.",1,0,5772,5772,"My friend (""Samantha"") is a stay-at-home mom and has a four-year-old daughter (""Katie""). Since her daughter's birth, she always insisted that I go to her place if I ever wanted to hang out. Even though she lives about 45 minutes away from me, I always did it in the beginning because I did value our friendship, and Katie was her first, so I could understand how she'd be stressed with a newborn.

Recently, I started to put my foot down and wanted her to meet me halfway. I felt like her kid (she only has Katie) was old enough to handle being outside and I was tired of driving just to hang at her house. We always picked a place halfway, so I felt like it was doable. 

During the last three hangouts, she was over 30 minutes late, and each time she claimed that she got ""mom privileges"" for being late because she had to wrangle her kid into the car and do other ""mom things"" I wouldn't understand (according to her. I'm childless). 

She asked to hang out this past weekend, and I told her that if she was late again, I'd leave. Lo and behold, the day came and she was late. After 30 minutes, I got up and left, but went to hang in the coffeeshop across the street because I was curious just how late she'd be. She was over an hour late, and when she found out from the waitress that I left, she started to call and text me. 

She said that I was callous and selfish for making her drive 25 minutes away from home with a toddler only to leave, and that she only ever came out for my benefit. I told her that I hang out with multiple friends who bring their kids out with us, and they're never late, so it was pretty shitty to blame being late on Katie (who is a perfectly sweet girl. She's never been a problem during our outings). Samantha just kept pulling the ""you're not a mom so you wouldn't get it"" card. 

I heard later from a mutual friend that Samantha has been blasting me in their mommy group and said I was bullying her for putting her child first. I feel like her reaction wouldn't be so strong unless she was actually upset, so I'm starting to kind of feel like an AH. I mean, she's right that I don't ""get it"" as I don't have children, but I still feel annoyed that she's late and feel justified for leaving. My time is precious too!

Today I got a phone call from a unit clerk on the maternity floor, the conversation went as follows.

Me: (answers phone call) Lab, this is Ashley.
UC: Hi Kim, could you send us down a few viral swabs when you get a moment?
Me: Sure! ...Can I ask you a question?
UC: Go ahead!
Me: Why do you think my name is Kim? You're not the only one who does it, I either get called Kim or Kate. I'm not upset or anything. I'm just trying to understand why.
UC: (sounding kind of offended) I thought that's what you said. What did you say?
Me: No, I said Lab this is Ashley.
UC: (acting like I'm verbally attacking them) Well I thought you said Kim (hangs up)

For context. I do not know if I have spoken to this person specifically before but for the duration that I have worked here I have always answered the phone the same way and on a weekly basis get called Kate/Kim. I wasn't trying to call this person out specifically I was genuinely trying to ask why they thought I said Kim. I keep trying to figure it out but Ashley and Kim sound nothing alike. I was trying to find out in I was muffled or sound like I'm mumbling but instead they seemed really upset that I asked.

"AITA for watching a TV show my w/ my partner that I’ve already seen?","Oh the audacity of you having a life before him!
I'd call this a red flag to keep in mind.",5,0,17,17,"My (25M) parter and I (25F) got into an argument over watching a TV show I’ve already seen. For context, my partner and I have been together almost a year (just a month shy) and things have always been really great. However, this particular night is throwing me for a loop and I’m not sure if I’m in the wrong. 

The night of our argument, my partner had been home all day working on taxes, school, and a few errands he needed to run. He does have a full time job so no, he isn’t a stay at home, video game playing bf (learned that lesson the hard way years ago).  I work a 9-5 and got home just before 5 o’clock. My partner and I chatted about our day like usually and I showed him a lot of support for a new job opportunity he was exploring. We hung out on the couch for a while and I got up to make dinner around 6 o’clock. Prior to doing so we settled on a show to watch after clicking through Netflix for 10 minutes. I saw something I knew was good and had really enjoyed myself when I watched it when it released in 2019. 

I said “hey this is super good” and my bf put it on. We watched an episode, I began cooking as the second started, and we ate while the third played. I cleaned up part of dinner and we were on the couch when I said “god I forgot how good this was I’m going to try not to spoil anything with my reactions” and my bf started at me. I asked what was wrong and he said “you’ve seen this?” And I said yeah several years ago when it first came out but I don’t remember a lot, just the ending. He was visibly upset and irritated. I asked what the problem was and he began to change the channel while explained how watching a TV show one of us has seen already was different than watching a movie one of us has seen already. I kept asking what the big deal was because we’ve watched shows before that I’ve seen. He said a TV show was an investment and watching something one of us has already seen wasn’t the same was feeling the emotions for the first time together.

I said “okay” and he told me to lose my attitude. I said okay again and he said I needed to stop being disrespectful. He got up, went to the bathroom to brush his teeth and slammed both doors to the bedroom/bathroom leaving me alone on the couch. For context, I’ve watch numerous movie recommendations from him that are of various comedic genres. I’ve never been a fan of comedies as they just aren’t my thing (I’m more of a romantic drama or si-fy/fantasy kinda gal) but knowing how much he likes them I’ve always watched and truly enjoyed his recommendations. I don’t understand why watching this TV show would be any different but maybe I’m just overlooking something and being inconsiderate.

Lily is a bully. I have met her a handful of times and she is always making fun of Eni, who is a little fat, Lily's always telling that bad pig jokes and she even gave Eni a nickname, Pigni.
I have complained to Tom and Tom's mom that Lily's jokes weren't funny and she should stop, but they always said she was just joking. I told Eni that she should return the jokes to Lily, but she can never think of anything to say.
Last year I was invited to Tom's family's Christmas party, everything was fine until Lily said something like ""Oh God Eni, you've already eaten so much, at this pace you'll stop being Pigni to become Whalni"" and she laugh with the children at the party. I was furious and Eni and Tom gave a fake laugh and said that Eni was 4 months pregnant. When we were all congratulating them, Lily said ""wow, at least now you can excuse yourself when people see you eating like a pig."" I got furious again but Eni asked me to just let it go but I know how much that jokes hurt her. So I went back to having a talk with Tom and his mother about why Lily's teasing had to stop.
 Well, this weekend was Eni's babyshower, we were having a good time until Lily told another joke about how ""fat"" Eni had gotten, I had enough so I laughed so loud to attract attention and said ""Oh Lily, you're so funny, especially when you finish your jokes with that ugly pig laugh, sometimes I think people laugh more at your laugh than at your joke."" Lily got super serious and she told me it wasn't funny, to which I said ""come on, it's a joke"" and imitated her laugh, the kids at the party laughed too and Lily ran away while she cried. Tom's mother scolded me for the joke and I asked her why Lily's jokes were funny but mine weren't, if they both had a pig joke in it, and her mother couldn't answer me. I told her that every time I heard Lily tell a joke about Eni, I would return the joke. Eni told me that I shouldn't have done that, but I could see her hold back her laughter along with the other guests, but I'm tired of Eni being walked over.

"AITA for choosing not to pay for my daughter's university fees despite paying for her brothers?","> she has decided to be ""herself"".

You've decided to be yourself, haven't you? And now you've decided that your adult daughter should also be yourself.

What do you think her life is going to be like if she lets anybody else decide who she's going to be against her own wishes? Do you want her to live life letting other people make those decisions for her? Maybe get married and let her husband decide even more things with no regard for what she wants, so she disappears behind a lifelong, ""Yes, Dear""? Cause that's what you're asking for, here.",11,0,3369,3369,"My (57M) daughter Jane (21F) has recently been accepted into the university of her choice ,now me and my wife (55F) are glad with this news , the only thing is that Jane got accepted to do an English degree.

Now Jane, compared to her two brothers Mark (28M) and Leo (30M) was quite late in applying to university. When me and my wife asked her to start at 18 she claimed that she was not ready and wanted to have a ""little rest"", a little rest being going out with friends and travelling the whole of last year with her boyfriend.

It should be noted that I supplied Jane with all the money needed for her little rest .

Now me and my wife have nothing against Jane doing what she did, she's young and young people live to explore and do what they do, however before me and my wife allowed for Jane to do her thing we made her promise that when she did apply to university it was for a degree that was worth it - Jane was going through a weird phase where she wanted to be many things that were more on the creative side.

Fast forward a year later we find out that Jane's gone behind our backs and applied for an English degree.

Both Leo and Mark took medical degrees and are now very good, well payed doctors. One would think that this would motivate Janet to go on the same path but instead she has decided to be ""herself"".

I sat down Jane last night and told her that if she decided to go through with the English degree, I would not support her at all and that she would have to take out her own student loan, at this she began crying claiming that I was the ""worst dad ever"" and had always favoured her brothers over her (because I had paid for their university fees) - now this is totally incorrect I did literally pay for her travel all of last year.

My sons think that I'm being too harsh and that I should simply support Jane regardless of what she chooses, but is it too much to ask of my daughter to follow through with an actually useful degree?

EDIT: No, my daughter's year of travel does not add up to her brothers tuition fees, not even close. For those wondering I work as a cardiologist. 

Me not wanting my daughter to do an English degree is not because I'm sexist but because I want her to do something useful which she can live off instead of depending on me for the rest of her life.

I said sure and sent him my username and password - but under the condition that I get to kick him out if he's watching it and I want to (I only have single screen access). He said that was fine.

This morning I went to watch the last episode and I got a message that I'm already watching somewhere else, so I message him asking him to quit so I can watch. (I know, sort of a dick move, but we did agree those terms, and also I only had an hour free this morning before work). He replies that it's not him, but that he'll ask ""Samantha"" to sign out. Samantha is a friend of his.

I ask why Samatha has my login and he said he shared it with her. I asked why the hell he thought that was appropriate, and he said it's no big deal, she just wanted to watch the show too, she's a friend of his and I've met her and ""like her"", so I shouldn't care either. I told him that was a ridiculous thing to say, and he had no right to do that. 

I immediately signed into my account, kicked them both out and changed the password.

I (28f) and husband (30M) do not have kids. We both have decent paying jobs and a real estate. That said we love to travel and many times also pay & invite our families to go with us.
My brother (26M) married and had my nephew (4m) with my middle school best friend (28F). Yes, he married my best friend and we are still best friends. They had my nephew and years later divorced.

To the Point: My brother started dating his new GF we will call her Ashley. They’ve been together for around 9 ish months. They’re not engaged or married. She has a son who is 5, we will call him John. I’ve only met John a handful of times. He’s a nice kid but I don’t really know him. I only know Ashley on an first name basis in a way. We talk occasionally but nothing in depth.

I invited my ex SIL& nephew to Disney this summer for 6 days. 2 days in Disney, 1 in Universal. The remaining days would be chill/Orlando days.
We are paying for them to go. I’ve always wanted to take nephew to Disney since he was smaller. He loves Mickey! We didn’t tell him in front of John or Ashley. 
But it made it back to Ashley that we are taking him. She confronts me at a family dinner on the side& tells me she’s upset we are not including her child and that he should have been invited. She said he doesn’t feel like he fits in/ is family and that is excluding him from Disney has made him cry all night. I was so shocked.

We are easily paying $2k for my nephew & best friend to go. Tickets, airfare, lodging, and of course some toys. 

I blew up. I told her that I didn’t even know her or her kid. They have only been around for a few months & he’s not my nephew. I told her I didn’t like the entitled mentality and to make it a point I would make sure to exclude her from all future family gatherings. She left crying. My brother and parents are all upset with me. That I’m excluding this child& isolated them. I told them if they’d like to pay for them I don’t mind them tagging along but they all said “You have more means than us”. They’re not doing great financially which is why I didn’t ask in the beginning. She made a huge FB post and everyone is siding with her. 

Did I go too far? Should I have offered to include them? AITA? 

TLDR: I’m paying for my nephew to go to Disney but I didn’t invite my brothers girlfriends son also. When approached I blew up on her for even approaching me. Now my family is upset! AITA?",1706,"Friendly_Tangelo1197","Stable-Personal",0
"AITA for giving a computer to my student instead of my son?","While reading your post, your passion for teaching and inspiring younger people in your country was eye-catching. I am so thankful teachers like you exist, especially in countries where education, learning and inner motivation should be encouraged. I see, from my point of view, no problem with giving such a thoughtful en appropriate gift to one of your students, especially if they are as motivated to learn as you have told. I personally have worked with Raspberry Pi (still magic to me), so it is telling that your pupil and his family appreciate this thoughtful gift of yours. You likely changed your pupil's life, with your attention and the opportunities this creates for him. 

Regarding your wife and son's reaction, they expected you to give the Raspberry Pi to him without communicating this. Please consider why this is so! Is this normal behaviour for your wife?  I understand your very young son was expecting this new 'toy', especially when one of his parents might have told him it was a gift. But your wife's reaction regarding the student's family's acceptance of the gift was quite telling.

She might believe that a 'poor' family cannot appreciate this gift, and thus giving the Raspberry to your pupil is a waste of money. She expected you to always prioritise your children and thus assumed that you would have only bought such a gift for your family.

Consider this point of view and make your own determination. With your son, take some time out of your day and talk to him. Try to explain how important teaching is to you and especially why, in an age-appropriate manner. Do explain that this student was very interested in the subject, and you wanted to foster his interest. And also considered the different ages of the people involved. 

Regarding your wife, your son is following her example of not talking. Short breaks to reduce emotions of tempers are okay ( 1-2 hours max.) however, extended periods of no communication are not healthy for relationships. I hope you can address this as adults in a healthy way. Do consider this, expenses as vast as the Raspberry Pi should be discussed in relationships, especially if children are involved.",90,0,108,108,"Reposting because bot didn't sent me a PM and got removed.  I'm 32yo M. I have a computer degree and work for the Ministry of education in my country. This is a very poor country, and most students have very limited access to technology. I started a program to teach programming and some basic of Linux to students, and has gone well so far. Part of the program also includes creating Kiwix (offline wikipedia) labs and in some schools, creating local clouds so files wont be lost of misplaced. 

In one of the schools there is this student, a 15yo, who from the beginning has shown a lot of interest in learning. He is already doing some nice little projects, but his family is extremely poor so hi does what he can in an old Intel Atom notebook. I thought him how to use what little he can in that notebok using Linux and even upgrading to an SSD.

I have many computers, but I think my favorite one is the Raspberry Pi 400, for those who doesn't know, it's a little ARM based computer built into a keyboard form factor, unaware people just see a keyboard with an unusual amount of ports, when they realize this is a full computer, their minds are blown. This might sound silly for people in the first world, but here this is top notch tech.

So, this one student has some fascination with this Pi. He touches as if it was made of crystal when I let him use it, and together we managed to do some cool stuff.

His birthday was this month, when I knew the date of his birthday, I decided to commit a sin. Buy a full Pi400 kit from a reseller (because these are nearly impossible to buy in official retails right now) and import it. It came right on time, and gave it to him as a birthday present.

He was so excited that started crying, and his family had no idea how to thank me. It melted my heart.

Then I told this to my wife and my 8yo son, and they are mad at me. Apparently he wanted a pi for himself, just failed to communicate it, but they blasted me for giving a Pi to ""a random kid"" and when they saw the Pi arriving home, though I was gonna give it to him. They also told me that the student's family might 100% resell it since they're so poor. My son already has 3 computers, one of them a mid-budget gaming PC. He is also into software but is still too young to do more complex things. I dont know why he suddenly wanted a Pi so much. Neither of them are talking to me.

Some of the highlights of this text message:

-we are missing key milestones of their kids lives after missing their first child’s 1st birthday 
(My wife and I were separated during COVID because I was in Canada and she was in USA, the birthday party fell on a weekend we were able to see each other for the first time in 6 months - I hadn’t even met my nephew because I wasn’t allowed in the country)

-we were an hour late to their 2nd birthday 
(My wife and her aunt share this birthday and my SIL/BIL refuse to share their child’s birthday with anyone so they were exchanging gifts ahead of the party)

-we left after their second child’s baptism instead of going to a second location for pizza and cake due to “poor planning”
(We live 2 hours away and they had the baptism on a Sunday night. They didn’t even attend the mass before - we did. We did not want to drive another hour in the wrong direction after because it was already dark, we had work the next day and also had a dog sitter waiting with our puppy)

We are now missing the first birthday party because we are seeing my family in Canada for Easter since we didn’t see them at Christmas because of a snow storm. My SIL now claims we make no effort, that she won’t lie to her kids when they ask why we are missing from pictures and that her kids hardly ask about us because they don’t see us. 

Some added info: we are never asked about our availability, have never been invited over outside of large family events and they’ve declined 2/3 invites we’ve sent them because we live “too far”

Kids can suck and Lily still gets to experience plenty of her culture at home. There's nothing wrong with letting her have sandwiches for school if thats what she wants.

Hell it's not even a school thing, my old workplace implemented a ""no hot food at your desk"" rule to not-so-subtly ban the guy who microwaved salmon every day. ""No strongly smelling food in public indoor spaces"" is going to be a common theme throughout her whole life regardless of whether it's Indian, Chinese or English (reheated brussel sprouts were also referenced in our ban).",0,0,4439,4439,"My wife Sara (36F) and I (35M) have an 11 year old daughter named Lily. Lily had begun attending 6th grade in September, but this problem only recently became a major issue. Sara is Indian and makes great dishes that the whole family enjoys, and tends to pack these lunches for Lily as well. She typically packs Lily a rice with dal in a container or something similar, which she had no issues with in elementary school.

However, recently Lily came sobbing to her mom and I about the lunches she took. The kids at school had been making fun of her food, which absolutely made my heart break. I had struggled with the same thing at her age (I come from a Chinese family and would always take homemade food to school too) and when I asked her if she wanted us to report the problem, she begged us not to so she wouldn't be called a ""snitch"" or worse. When Sara heard this, she simply contacted the principal, which I didn't want to resort to at first, and left the issue, telling Lily she wouldn't be buying school lunch and to just ignore the other kids.

The same problem occured every day, Lily would be coming home feeling extremely upset and there were even times Sara would yell at Lily for not even touching her school lunch. We both had talks with Lily about her culture and how she should be proud, have contacted the schools, but the school is ignorant of the issue (they simply had a talk with the parents, and ended it there) and Lily isn't budging. I don't want her to starve, because so many days she doesn't even eat her lunch. I know how brutal middle schoolers can be, and I didn't want Lily to feel insecure or upset even if it meant making her take other lunches, but Sara refuses to make other lunches.

I began to make other lunches for Lily, like sandwiches, or sometimes mac n' cheese, so she'd feel more comfortable eating it in school in front of her classmates as a final resort when nothing else worked. I would take Lily's lunch for myself at work and pack her own lunch early in the morning, which she finished and seemed happier when coming home daily after. However, this only worked for about 2 weeks until Sara found out and was infuriated. She said I was denying Lily her culture and she needed to learn to stop being insulted by other kids, telling me I'm raising Lily to get whatever she wants. Is Sara right? AITA?

EDIT: Bringing this post and topic up tonight, I'll post an update when I can. Hopefully this is enough to convince Sara- if not, I'll do what other comments said and just keep packing Lily's lunch or let her pick.

"AITA for telling my boyfriend's dad he was dead?","YTA",0,0,171,171,"My boyfriend left home on his eighteenth birthday after a big fight with his dad. He tried to reach out after that, but his dad completely ignored him and wanted nothing to do with him. My boyfriend was really depressed about it, but he eventually got over it. I remember one night we all got drunk (we're apartment sharing with friends) and he told us that he was dead to his father, and that stuck with me.

Yesterday, he just showed up, my boyfriend's dad, that is. Myself and one of our roommates were the only people home. I answered the door, but I didn't let him in. He said he wanted to talk to his son and I said ""oh, your dead son?"" He must not have remembered or understood the reference, because he went completely pale and asked how/when he died. He looked almost as upset as my boyfriend had been, so I decided to let him stew in it.

I told him a fake story. He looked like he was going to throw up, and he asked if he could come in and have some water. I reluctantly let him, because he seemed very ill. Once inside, my roommate saw us and asked what was going on. My boyfriend's dad asked if he knew his son, and my roommate was super confused and it quickly came out that my boyfriend wasn't actually dead.

My boyfriend's dad was furious. He said I was a sick person with a hateful heart. I told him he said his son was dead to him, so why would he even care. He said he made a mistake in a moment of anger, but I made a cold-blooded decision. My roommate also said that what I did was fucked up.

I went to our room and called my boyfriend, who said to make sure his dad left before he came home, which I did, and he did, reluctantly. I didn't tell my boyfriend about the dead thing, just that he showed up and seemed to regret things. My boyfriend is shocked by his dad just showing up and I don't want to pile more on. My roommate said I was a huge asshole because ""no one deserves that,"" but I'm not sure. He did look so sick, but part of me thinks he brought it all upon himself. I don't know.

Edit: One of you made a compelling case to tell my boyfriend as soon as possible about telling his dad he was dead. He wanted to know what his dad's reaction was and kept asking if he said anything other than asking for more information before he found out it was a lie. He only really asked questions like ""When? How? Was it sudden?"" and such, and my boyfriend was pretty disappointed by that. He's pretty depressed this morning.",171,"goofballrmjk","NotVeryFriend",0

A little over three years ago my sister had an accident in a sport which landed her in a coma. 

Layla’s horse is boarded about a 4 hour drive from where I (and most of my family) live. My older brother (Jacob, 29M) and his mom live less than an hour away from the stable. The horse is fully trained and Layla used to compete with him. The arrangement has always been that most of the horse’s expenses would be paid for by Jacob’s mom (our dad isn’t in the picture for any of us) as well as my mom and stepdad. After Layla’s accident, Jacob started contributing financially to the horse’s needs and even started riding him. 


Last week my parents asked me if we could “have a talk”. When I got to my parents’ house, My best friend and Layla’s longterm boyfriend (Thomas, 21M) was also there and didn’t know why he was called over either. 

My parents pretty bluntly told the both of us that they were going to sell Layla’s horse because it’s unlikely that she’ll ever wake up again and it’s not reasonable to keep putting money into the animal. 

I asked if they’d spoken to Jacob or his mom about this, since they’re the horse’s primary caretakers and put a fair amount of money in as well. My parents said they hadn’t spoken to Jacob or his mom, and they shouldn’t have to because it’s Layla’s horse and they’re her parents. 

Thomas disagreed with this, and offered to contribute financially to the horse, as well as driving up to take care of him. If and when Layla does wake up, she’s going to want to know her horse is okay. I agreed with Thomas, and put out the same offer. 

My parents told the both of us that we’re not thinking clearly and it’s better for everyone if the horse is just sold. This decision didn’t sit right with me so I called Jacob and asked what he thought about the matter. Jacob wants to keep the horse and so does his mother, and his mom has said that she will fully pay for the horse’s expenses by herself if it comes to it. My parents told Jacob that he just needs to get over it because it’s not his choice, and hung up on him. 

Once the call had ended, my parents said that I was completely wrong for calling Jacob for his opinion, and that they’re disappointed in both Thomas and I for even considering keeping the horse. Both my parents are upset now, they won’t answer my calls and have also seemed to cut contact with Thomas who was like a son to them. 

AITA for going against my parents on wanting to sell my sister’s horse and asking my brother his opinion on it?

ETA more info, replying to questions in the comments


The horse had nothing to do with Layla’s accident, she was athletic and involved in multiple sports at the time. 

As far as I know, my parents are completely fine with money, though it is possible that they’re just not telling me.

I’m not 100% sure as to who has the legal rights to the horse because we’ve always called him Layla’s and never really talked further about it, but I assume he belongs to my parents. 

Thomas and I are both in ongoing therapy, therapy was suggested to my mom a lot back when the accident first happened but I don’t think she ever went, and my stepdad refuses to go.

Both myself and Thomas still regularly go see Layla and spend hours if not the full day with her, the main reason for keeping so much hope is that occasionally there’ll be the slightest movements, yet obviously non-responsive or her heart rate will slightly pick up. My parents don’t go see her very often anymore, but they still ask both of us about how she is. 

Idk if it’s relevant but Layla and I are twins, and she had been dating Thomas since she was 13 and he was 14, which explains the extra attachment.

Other people do interact with the horse, he’s properly groomed and those of Layla’s friends who also boarded their horse there, as well as sometimes the owners of the stable will pet him and take him out into the paddock when they bring their own horses out and bring him in again. 

Layla has been in the coma for three years.

The horse is currently 17. The last time we got an offer on him was while Layla was dismounting after a competition. Back then, those offers were almost $44,000. Layla was the one to refuse that offer directly. That was about 6 months before the accident.

My boyfriend doesn't care as much as me of breakfast and doesn't even like yogurt and orange juice that much, so I usually make him something else with whatever was cheap on the supermarket that week and he never has a problem.

I have a friend 18f who studies in a city one hour away and recently came to visit for the weekend, she was our guest as we invited her. Everything was fine until Saturday morning. 

 I woke up early and had breakfast, she woke up a little later and said what I was eating looked great. I said thanks. 

When my boyfriend woke up I told them I could make them pancakes with dulce de leche, chocolate milk or coffee or tea, omelette, oatmeal, or homemade bread with butter or dulce de leche. 

I though that was an extremely vast amount of options, more than I normally have at home. I also had the morning free and didn't mind spending some time cooking so I was willing to make half elaborate breakfasts.
She asked me if she could have what I was eating, I was cut off guard but tried to explain in the nicest way possible that my breakfast is something I spend a little extra on myself because I really enjoy it and I can't really afford to feed everyone the same. 

She frowned and said something under her breath I don't remember now but agreed to have whatever my boyfriend wanted. Everything felt awkward for a couple hours but eventually we put it behind and enjoyed the rest of the weekend. She left yesterday and today she sent me a paragraph saying not sharing something like breakfast is greedy and it made her question if she wants to be friends with someone like that.
I wanted to apologize but my boyfriend said not to because she was acting entitled. AITA?

Edit: I wasn't planning on eating in front of her I just woke up early and thought she wouldn't wake up for at least an hour. I now know however I should have just not eaten that the same day. I understand and will apologize to her. However, I feel like people insulting me don't understand at all what being poor and having one thing to enjoy for yourself is. I try to share everything, I just have this one thing I really like and I spend a good portion of my income in. I didn't ask her for one penny for all the meals I fed her the weekend and I did had to budget to afford them.",5148,"kumorithecloud","Opposite-Intern-4692",0

"When did you find out that someone in your family is evil?","TW: violence 

My older sister is a sociopath. She’s 7 years older than me and she was horrible my whole life but there’s one incident that really sticks out. My family was dysfunctional on many levels and holidays weren’t usually a thing bc my parents never seemed to like us kids having any joy. Anyways when I was 14 they decided this year we would celebrate thanksgiving which we’d never done previously. I was opening the cranberry sauce when she lost it bc it wasn’t the ‘right’ one. She jump on me knocking me to the ground and tried to gouge my eyes out telling me I ‘didn’t deserve to see anymore’ yeah…when I was 18 I cut contact with all of them.

Second one…unfortunately I ended up in an abusive relationship when I was an adult bc that behavior was so normalized. I had three kids with him and he was horrible both mentally and physically to me. Once he told me if he was “going to rape and kill anyone it’s be me and he’d know where to hide the body.” He also would say he wanted to know what it felt like to kill someone and would tell me how if he did he’d draw it out for as long and as painful as possible. I wanted to leave but I had no friends and from the example above clearly no family. I’d call women’s shelters but there was never any spots for me and my kids. One day I found out he had been telling everyone I was mentally unwell and that I was suicidal (I wasn’t) and that he was worried one day he’d come home he’d find me with “blood everywhere.” I believe he was setting it up to kill me and get away with it. Plus his dad was a police sergeant and they both told me he’d never get in trouble for anything he did. I didn’t want to die so I got a permanent restraining order.

He tried to reach out after that, but his dad completely ignored him and wanted nothing to do with him. My boyfriend was really depressed about it, but he eventually got over it. I remember one night we all got drunk (we're apartment sharing with friends) and he told us that he was dead to his father, and that stuck with me.

Yesterday, he just showed up, my boyfriend's dad, that is. Myself and one of our roommates were the only people home. I answered the door, but I didn't let him in. He said he wanted to talk to his son and I said ""oh, your dead son?"" He must not have remembered or understood the reference, because he went completely pale and asked how/when he died. He looked almost as upset as my boyfriend had been, so I decided to let him stew in it.

I told him a fake story. He looked like he was going to throw up, and he asked if he could come in and have some water. I reluctantly let him, because he seemed very ill. Once inside, my roommate saw us and asked what was going on. My boyfriend's dad asked if he knew his son, and my roommate was super confused and it quickly came out that my boyfriend wasn't actually dead.

My boyfriend's dad was furious. He said I was a sick person with a hateful heart. I told him he said his son was dead to him, so why would he even care. He said he made a mistake in a moment of anger, but I made a cold-blooded decision. My roommate also said that what I did was fucked up.

I went to our room and called my boyfriend, who said to make sure his dad left before he came home, which I did, and he did, reluctantly. I didn't tell my boyfriend about the dead thing, just that he showed up and seemed to regret things. My boyfriend is shocked by his dad just showing up and I don't want to pile more on. My roommate said I was a huge asshole because ""no one deserves that,"" but I'm not sure. He did look so sick, but part of me thinks he brought it all upon himself. I don't know.

Edit: One of you made a compelling case to tell my boyfriend as soon as possible about telling his dad he was dead. He wanted to know what his dad's reaction was and kept asking if he said anything other than asking for more information before he found out it was a lie. He only really asked questions like ""When?

Sunday my grandmother said to my dad's wife that she liked her so much that when they get divorced she will keep her and get rid of my dad.

My dad's wife looked a little thrown by the comment and said she and my dad aren't getting divorced. I joked ""of course not, you don't have a daughter."" She stared at me and asked what I meant. I explained that my dad only divorces women when they have a daughter. That isn't the reason my parents divorced, it was just a joke about a coincidence, but she said it was a horrible thing to say about my sisters.

My grandmother then joked that it was the opposite, because it implied my dad wanted daughters and only stayed with a woman long enough to get one, so as long as she doesn't have another kid or only has sons he'll stick around waiting for a girl. We both started laughing, and my dad's wife stared at us silently and then got up and left the room. At this point I started to wonder if I crossed a line.

I felt absolutely appalled when she said this, as me and the teacher have, up until now, always maintained a very friendly relationship. She added that the lunches I’m packing my son are “very distracting for the other students and have an unpleasant odor.” I told her that I understand her concerns, as the lunches I pack are definitely not the healthiest, but the lunches are according to my son’s preferences.

I ended the call by saying that I very much appreciated her worries, but that at the end of the day, I am not going to drastically change my sons’ lunches all of a sudden, and that it’s not my fault if other students are “distracted” by his meal. It is very important to me what my son enjoys, and I want him to like my lunches.

So, he was out of town for two weeks, came back for a few days, and then left again for a long weekend. Our nanny needed to cut hours so we've been relying on grandmas to help since I work full time. The first week kiddo was fine until he stayed with my MIL- that day he fully skipped the nap, went down at 5 pm, and woke up at 3 am the next day. For the next 4 days we couldn't get him down for a nap, but after setting a routine around the house he did better. Asked MIL to come down to our house for the next week, she refused. I made other arrangements but told her she was welcome to stop by regardless. She was then upset and said we treated her unfairly/blamed her for the sleep issue. I explained it was the change of scenery and overstimulation and that's why we asked her to come down-- she refused to back down and has been trying to cause issues since.

Fast forward to last weekend- my mom is with me and kiddo, and I tell her I needed to take a few minutes to hang a mirror (which she couldn't do) because he's getting into everything. She argues with me that I shouldn't try to put in wall anchors, and gets angry when I push back. She proceeds to say my selfishness/ lack of attention/care is why my kid is ""struggling"".

No agreement on how and when he pays her back? This is not a loan, it is a gift.",1,0,1204,1204,"Throwaway account b/c family reads reddit.

I(35M) was asked by my wife(34F) about the bonus I received at work this year. When I told her about what I got, she asked me if I could loan her $10k. Since she's never asked me for this before I asked what it was for. She said it was to ""help"" her brother buy a house, and she would give him the loan and she would pay me back in monthly installments in $1k. When I asked why she wouldn't just loan him directly, she said it was because she wanted some buffer in her own finances(we have a joint account for bills but don't really mix finances). I had a bunch of questions:

Is this a gift? No, he says he will pay me back.

How would we pay this to him? She would send him the money(He lives in another country).

When is he buying the house? He's just putting a down payment on the build. It's not built yet.

When is he planning on paying you back? He'll pay it back but no idea when.

Wife is adamant that she'll pay me back, and handle it if her brother decides not to pay back. I was really concerned that her brother might not pay her back and I told her as much. My big concern is that he'll pull a ""you're married to a rich American and so I don't have to pay you back"" line on her. There's no real recourse if he doesn't and I don't think that they're really that close. Plus he lives on the other side of the planet(China). I've had a lot of questions and concerns as I've been burned loaning friends/family money in the past and my wife finally just said she wasn't going to loan him money and that she now can't rely on me for financial aid anymore(we share bills, but I pay about 75% of everything as I make more) . I've offered alternatives but wife shut it down. Now she's mad and isn't really talking to me. She says that she doesn't want to talk about it anymore. AITA here?

I think I might be because:

I can probably swing this

Wife is guaranteeing it.

I might not be because:

It's a bad idea to loan money to family.

Kai was upset and was talking about how much it sucked. I told him I got it. He said everyone in his family was telling him he should be happy because he wouldn't have to listen to his parents fight anymore and he should be happy they're divorcing. Kai said he wasn't. I told him neither was I. That I knew nobody with divorced parents who wanted them to be divorced or were happy about it. I told him most of my friends have divorced parents and all of them wish it hadn't happened. Heather and her sister overheard what I said to Kai and I got into so much trouble for saying it.

This is because I am ginger, my husband is blonde but our baby came out with dark hair. He freaked out in the delivery room and his behavior got him kicked out the hospital. I had to beg him to do a paternity test and he finally agreed after a month, and it proved that I didn't cheat. We had been together since we were 13 so I was devastated and all I wanted was him back, but I've come to my senses and decided that someone who believes that school level punnet squares are the be all and end all of biological inheritance is not the type of person I wanna be with. I was also treated like crap by everyone but my older brother, Alex, while we were waiting for the results because they all thought I had cheated. It was a horrible experience and as a result, I've lost many friends and family members. 

Since the results came back, my ex has been begging me to get back with him. I moved in with Alex after we split, and he comes almost everyday to beg me to get back with him. My in laws have also been harassing me too, especially my MIL who has come over four times in the past week asking me to forgive her son and to 'let God back into my heart'. I used to be a Christian and so are all my in laws and my family, but how I was treated when my baby was born made me lose faith fast. The whole church community treated me like trash during this whole ordeal and it made me want nothing to do with them anymore and I don't want to raise my son in that sort of community.

They practically forced their way in, and I was being berated like a child for not forgiving my ex's 'lapse in judgement'.

I have Indian friends in American and the women dress western here except for festivals.

Now Jane, compared to her two brothers Mark (28M) and Leo (30M) was quite late in applying to university. When me and my wife asked her to start at 18 she claimed that she was not ready and wanted to have a ""little rest"", a little rest being going out with friends and travelling the whole of last year with her boyfriend.

It should be noted that I supplied Jane with all the money needed for her little rest .

Now me and my wife have nothing against Jane doing what she did, she's young and young people live to explore and do what they do, however before me and my wife allowed for Jane to do her thing we made her promise that when she did apply to university it was for a degree that was worth it - Jane was going through a weird phase where she wanted to be many things that were more on the creative side.

Fast forward a year later we find out that Jane's gone behind our backs and applied for an English degree.

Both Leo and Mark took medical degrees and are now very good, well payed doctors. One would think that this would motivate Janet to go on the same path but instead she has decided to be ""herself"".

I sat down Jane last night and told her that if she decided to go through with the English degree, I would not support her at all and that she would have to take out her own student loan, at this she began crying claiming that I was the ""worst dad ever"" and had always favoured her brothers over her (because I had paid for their university fees) - now this is totally incorrect I did literally pay for her travel all of last year.

My sons think that I'm being too harsh and that I should simply support Jane regardless of what she chooses, but is it too much to ask of my daughter to follow through with an actually useful degree?

EDIT: No, my daughter's year of travel does not add up to her brothers tuition fees, not even close. For those wondering I work as a cardiologist. 

Me not wanting my daughter to do an English degree is not because I'm sexist but because I want her to do something useful which she can live off instead of depending on me for the rest of her life. 

I don't even know if this is something she really wants to do or if it's another way of trying to rebel against me.",3369,"sleepy-ab","Impressive-Mix-31",0

Edit: Forgot to mention what those expenses were the expenses in question was a title or medal that we had to go on stage and take these titles were based off of the nicknames each of us were given throughout our college year and we had to make a speech after taking our thing (idk what to call it) so I told them I don't want them to make a medal or title thing for me and they still made it I just didn't want to give the speech on stage

"AITA for expecting my boyfriends parents to treat my daughter the same as his daughters?","2 Vouchers is more than what I got from my parents at Christmas…. And I’m there 18 year old son",18,0,9765,9765,"I (37F) have been dating Martin (39) for what will be 2 years this June. I have a daughter, Scarlett (10) and he has 2 daughters: Miley (13) and Joanna (12). I am a single mother to Scarlett. Her father sends me maintenance each month but has never been an active parent and has never met Scarlett. I also grew up in care so I have no family or anything. Whereas Martin is divorced and shares custody with his ex-wife. Their custody agreement is very flexible with the girls sometimes staying with him or their mum longer or often spending times with both parents together. It really bothered me a lot that he was still good friends with his ex-wife and Martin said if I couldn’t handle the fact he could coparent well and be amicable with his ex then he would end things. I like to think I got over my jealousy and that the girls mother and I get on. 

Anyway since we’ve been dating a while and have started discussing potentially living together I think it’s only really fair that Scarlett is more involved and treated the same as Martin’s daughters by his parents. She met them for the first time a few months ago and has since seen them a few times since but she’s treated virtually like a stranger. At Christmas, Miley and Joanna were spoilt rotten. They got money, gifts, toys, gift vouchers and makeup. All they got Scarlett was an embroidered blanket thing Martin’s mother spent weeks knitting apparently with her name on it, two gift vouchers and a doll.

They’ll take Martin’s girls for overnight sleepovers but my kid is excluded. They say because they don’t know her that well and are uncomfortable looking after her for now. They’ll buy Joanna and Miley sweets or little trinkets and give them a couple of pounds here and there every so often but as for Scarlett, they might only give her one thing and that’s it. It’s not fair for Scarlett.

The last straw was when his parents asked if we would all like to go to Disneyland Paris in Easter with them. They offered to pay for Martin, the girls and said that they could pay for part of mine and Scarlett’s travel expenses, but that I’d have to pay the rest.  

I lost it and told Martin he needs to tell his parents to treat Scarlett like his girls are treated. It’s not fair to her that she has to watch her sisters being spoilt and she isn’t. He lashed out in return and said my parents have been nothing but accommodating to Scarlett by including her in things and getting her stuff at Christmas and so on. He said I’m incredibly selfish to expect his parents to treat my daughter who they barley know as the same as their grandchildren. He said that I’m bitter and jealous and it’s not like we’re married or living together. He used the example of the blanket being a really sweet gift that shows how much his mother cares. He also said it’s perfectly reasonable for his parents to expect me to pay for my own child to go to Disney and that my parents don’t need to pay anything at all for us. He also said I’m raising my daughter to not learn the value of the word no and that she can just be expected to get whatever he wants. He also said that Joanna and Miley are not Scarlett’s sisters, it’s never been emphasised they were and they do not view Scarlett as that. He said that I need to ‘get your arse in gear and realise nothing is being done to discriminate against or exclude Scarlett.’

AITA?

ETA: I view Joanna and Miley as bonus daughters, hence why Scarlett calls them her sisters. Joanna and Miley do not view me as a mother figure in anyway, only as ‘dad’s girlfriend.’ It really hurts but i don’t think im pushy or anything. I just think of us as a blended family unit whereas Joanna and Miley have said im just the woman their dad is dating and Scarlett is nothing to them family wise. I have tried to get them to involve her whenever they’re doing stuff and they outright refuse so they only as they put it ‘tolerate her.’ Martin has chewed me out about this before, claiming I’m trying to insert my daughter in the friendship groups and activities of his daughters and it greatly upsets Scarlett because she just wants to be included. She doesn’t have a lot of friends and I want Joanna and Miley to be her friends.

I have no family and Scarlett’s fathers family aren’t involved. I’ve always tried my best to spoil her myself but it seems only fair since we’re part of Martin’s family now that she’s treated the same as Joanna and Miley.",9765,"BenPlayWT2020","bfdaughterdrama",0

My husband and I have been married for almost 2 years. His ex-wife was a princess who never worked or contributed to the family but spent lavishly on herself. We both work but I make more money than he does and he is still paying the huge legall fees from his divorce but we have been splitting all our joint living expenses 50/50. Last year we got a $5000 refund from our joint tax return. We use my accountant so all the filings and returns go through me. For the same tax year I made a mistake on my elderly mothers tax return that cost  her almost $5000. I felt bad so I gave her our joint refund but didn't tell my husband we had gotten a refund nor that I was keeping it for my mom. He recently had a small financial windfall from an airline that thought they lost his luggage but really didn't. He used the money to pay me back money he owed me but i feel as though half that money should be mine anyway. When we argued about that he asked about our tax refund and i reluctantly him the truth. Now he is angry and says I'm like his ex-wife who always thought what was theirs was hers and what was his was theirs and that he could have used his half of the refund to pay some of his legal expenses. My mom is 93 and has savings plus an income from a job as well as social security but has high rent expenses.  So I think I was in the right. Also even though it was his luggage and he did all the legwork to get a refund from the airline I feel it was like winning the lottery so we should have shared the money. Is he right to feel angry or AITA for thinking that I had the right to use our refund to help my mother and that his windfall should be shared?",50,"QueballD","plaicecover",0

Clearly she was wrong but I was a kid and adapted. My father started legal proceedings against my mother and the whole thing took 6 years.

I would visit my father for half of summer vacation and many holidays. But I really loved my life with my mom.

When I was 14, my father basically threatened to have my mother arrested if she didn't let him have custody of me.

So against my own wishes, I was forced to move back to my dad's home full time.

I hated it here and I essentially lived a separate life from my dad and his family.

When I was 16, my grandad died and had left his company to his two sons (my dad and uncle) and me. We all got a third ownership. 

My dad and uncle had more kids but my grandfather never updated the will. My family says it's because he got too old to remember. 

So here is where I think I'm the asshole. Since I was 16, I didn't know any better and my dad and uncle just ran the company themselves.

But when I turned 18, my dad and uncle talked to me about splitting the company 50/50 between them so they could split it fairly among all the grandkids instead.

I would get a cash payout of $300k for my share.

But I talked to a lawyer on my own and refused to agree. In addition, I asked for my share of the profits since the past two years and that I'd be part of the business going forward while I was going to college.

This has made life extremely difficult for my dad. My uncle is extremely resentful that only one grandchild gets a huge stake. And my dad is now paying me my share of the profits for the past two years out of his own pocket just to keep the peace.

AITA? Maybe if I was on better terms with my father, I'd be open to their plan.

"AITA for telling my sister she was wrong for telling our parents WHY she doesn't want kids?","YTA

She didn't say anything about you. She described her own reasons not to want kids. And you're angry they don't match yours because you think it perpetuates some stereotype to avoid being upset with your parents who are confronting and pressuring you. Talk to THEM and accept your sister is her own person and is entitled to not want kids for any reason, including laziness or preferring to spend her money on herself.",1,0,1623,1623,"I always knew I didn't want to have kids. I don't have any specific reason for not wanting children, I just lack the desire and I strongly believe that the question should be ""why do you want kids?"" instead of ""why don't you want kids?"".

My older sister, Sadie, was very vocal about wanting to have children in her early 20s, but now that she is in her late 20s, she changed her mind.

Our parents never liked that I don't want kids, but they didn't care much about it either, since they knew Sadie will give them grandchildren. But now that Sadie changed her mind, they are panicking.

They invited us both over to dinner, then ""confronted"" us on why we don't want to have children and demanded a reason. I told them I just simply lack the desire and I expected Sadie to do the same, but instead, she threw me under the bus.

She decided to perpetuate the childfree stereotype and said that she is too lazy and selfish to have children. She doesn't want to start her mornings with making breakfast, getting the kids ready and taking them to school, she is just too lazy for that and doesn't want to give up her nice vacations and hobbies.
 
Thanks to her, now our parents are bugging me too and believe I'm a selfish, lazy person. I told Sadie she was wrong for telling our parents that's her reason and she should've thought about me before opening her mouth.

Sadie said she has every right to tell our parents whatever she wants and it's not her fault they are the way they are and that I can't stand up for myself. AITA?

Edit: She called herself lazy and selfish and that's what I have a problem with.

Edit 2: Again: nobody has to give a reason why they don't want kids, so no, there is no such thing as an invalid reason.

  We searched and posted on the local lost/found pets facebook pages and visited the local vet to see if they had been reported missing and scanned for a chip. No one claimed him. 

So we kept him.  My girlfriend, our other dog and I love him. He has gotten all his vaccines and is microchipped. Vet said he was a max age of 5 months old.

Well his original owner has surfaced and reached out to us. They want him back. The puppy had gone missing along with 3 cats and another dog, when the original owner's camper that they were all living in, was stolen. 

Their original owner is demanding him back, that they miss him and have been looking for him for months.

I'm refusing to give him back. My girlfriend feels terrible about it, and thought giving him back would be the right thing to do.

My wife is a teacher and she works her ass off to make sure we have a nice home to live in. She tells me what she needs me to do and I take care of it. Beyond my share of the housework I mean. 

Well my kid needs to be punished and I thought of the best possible way to do it.  I'm sending my wife to Mexico with her school friends over spring break.

YTA!",1,0,171,171,"My boyfriend left home on his eighteenth birthday after a big fight with his dad. He tried to reach out after that, but his dad completely ignored him and wanted nothing to do with him. My boyfriend was really depressed about it, but he eventually got over it. I remember one night we all got drunk (we're apartment sharing with friends) and he told us that he was dead to his father, and that stuck with me.

Yesterday, he just showed up, my boyfriend's dad, that is. Myself and one of our roommates were the only people home. I answered the door, but I didn't let him in. He said he wanted to talk to his son and I said ""oh, your dead son?"" He must not have remembered or understood the reference, because he went completely pale and asked how/when he died. He looked almost as upset as my boyfriend had been, so I decided to let him stew in it.

I told him a fake story. He looked like he was going to throw up, and he asked if he could come in and have some water. I reluctantly let him, because he seemed very ill. Once inside, my roommate saw us and asked what was going on. My boyfriend's dad asked if he knew his son, and my roommate was super confused and it quickly came out that my boyfriend wasn't actually dead.

My boyfriend's dad was furious. He said I was a sick person with a hateful heart. I told him he said his son was dead to him, so why would he even care. He said he made a mistake in a moment of anger, but I made a cold-blooded decision. My roommate also said that what I did was fucked up.

I went to our room and called my boyfriend, who said to make sure his dad left before he came home, which I did, and he did, reluctantly. I didn't tell my boyfriend about the dead thing, just that he showed up and seemed to regret things. My boyfriend is shocked by his dad just showing up and I don't want to pile more on. My roommate said I was a huge asshole because ""no one deserves that,"" but I'm not sure. He did look so sick, but part of me thinks he brought it all upon himself. I don't know.

Edit: One of you made a compelling case to tell my boyfriend as soon as possible about telling his dad he was dead. He wanted to know what his dad's reaction was and kept asking if he said anything other than asking for more information before he found out it was a lie. He only really asked questions like ""When? How? Was it sudden?"" and such, and my boyfriend was pretty disappointed by that. He's pretty depressed this morning.",171,"blue-liz","NotVeryFriend",0

Valerie has an 8 year old daughter who Tom adopted last year. Valerie and Tom are expecting another baby together. Their daughter had suggestions for names for her baby brother or sister. Namely names that were nature themed (Wren, Dove, Lark, River, Hawthorn, Forrest, Cove, Ocean). My name is actually among one she suggested. My own brother has a bird name along with me lol. Tom proceeded to tell his daughter that those were not real names and that I had always disliked/hated my name and they didn't want their little baby to be the same. He said this in front of me and my husband. My husband thought he was crazy and told him I had never said that. Tom glared at my husband. Then his daughter asked me if I hated my name and I said I didn't. Valerie said it didn't really matter what I thought, but they didn't want their kid to have a weird name and she told their daughter they wanted baby to have a lovely name like she has. Their daughter said she liked my name better and didn't think her name was nice. My husband and Tom's parents were like, let's not insult other people's names when Tom and Valerie started to protest and reminded them that they were in the presence of someone with one of the so called ""ridiculous names"".

Fast forward on a couple of hours and Tom came over and told me I needed to tell his daughter that names like mine do not work on people and that I want her to stop wanting a sibling called that and start embracing her name and the name they will give her future sibling. He told me just because I wanted to live like a freak with a weird ass name didn't mean he wanted that for his kids.

I told him he was a lying asshole for putting words in my mouth and expecting me to do the same. I told him nobody said he needed to like my name, but to insult it, to insult me and then ask me to lie with him was unbelievable. I told him I didn't need to lie for him and wouldn't and to get out of my fucking face.

My husband and I left almost immediately after, apologizing for leaving abruptly to my ILs and to our niece. Tom called my husband after and said his daughter could have heard and I was an asshole for saying what I did to him when she was in the house. My husband disagreed but I do wonder if I went too far.

Nigel was a widower of three years when he met my sister. His kids at the time of them meeting were 6f and 8m. Nigel's late wife's family was around a lot. My sister hated it. From the very early days it was clear she was toxically jealous of Nigel's late wife and the kids mom. She talked about how strange it was the kids, who didn't remember her, had her photo in their bedrooms, how her stepdaughter had a locket with a photo of her mom, dad and brother in it. I remember back then asking how it was strange. Her mom was loved and Nigel and his late wife's family likely didn't want the kids to not know they were loved by their mom. She said that was her job now. I told her it wasn't healthy to feel that jealous and put out over a mom being remembered. Think of how she would feel if our mom died.

Honestly, I had a lot of respect for Nigel for the first two or three years because his kids seemed to be his priority and he seemed to still love and care about his late wife and not want to erase her but was also ready to be married to someone else. I had seen a lot of far more awful scenarios. But then he started letting my sister push herself onto the kids and try to force out their maternal relatives. It was very clear my sister blamed the maternal relatives for neither of her stepkids coming to think of her as their mom. She didn't want to hear any other reason it could be.

Now both of her stepkids are adults and her stepson became a father for the first time in January. His daughter is named after both her grandmother's. But his mom's name is her first name. My sister was so unhappy about that. She told him it was disrespectful to her and all that crap. He told her to go fuck herself and told her she still hadn't figured out that she wasn't his mom, she wasn't his parent, she wasn't even his real family, because he would happily dump her out of his life for good and would never feel bad about that.

My sister bitched for weeks about it and then I told her if I was her stepkid, I'd do the same. That she had no respect for his mom and had no respect for his maternal family. She freaked out and told me that was a shitty thing to say and I should be on HER side, because she's my SISTER.

"AITA for reporting my classmates for joking that I have pretty privilege?","NTA. They're harassing you and other women just because they're pretty",73,0,29168,29168,"Background: I'm (F23) one of only a few female students in a male-dominated course. Furthermore, I am at a highly prestigious university and I haven't really gotten along with the guys on my course. They are all very competitive and I just don't really enjoy their company - everything turns into a pissing contest, and they definitely take me less seriously because I'm a woman. I stopped interacting with them beyond the mere minimum and choose to hang out with other people. 

Anyway:

I did well in our recent exams (I topped two out of four exams we had so far). Our prof congratulated me during class (I wouldn't have advertised this myself). Ever since then, my interactions with a specific group of male classmates have gotten weird. They're now outright rude and challenge me aggressively in class discussions. We recently had some presentations and one of them chose to do theirs on, to put it simply, ""pretty privilege"" - they specifically pointed to two papers that suggested that pretty female students get overscored in assessments. The other guys in the group snickered and one even gave me a wink. Afterwards, I heard them in the hallway joking that ""they had experience with that themselves"".

I've been seeing a PhD student within our department for a month. He has literally nothing to do with our course. Well, we ran into one of my course mates A together. The next day in class his friend B asked me if ""my boyfriend"" helped me with exams. He said this intentionally loudly and in front of the professor, who heard this. I replied that I don't have a boyfriend (cause he's not my bf), but then B pointed out that he had run into me with the PhD student, making a point to say his name (the prof knows him). I just replied that we're only friends.

They didn't let up - I heard that they discussed this thing in two more classes, in earshot of the professors. Both times they suggested I got help for my exams ( I wasn't even seeing him then). I didn’t confront them, but this has been causing me so much anxiety - even without the exam accusations, I worked hard to get here and I don’t want to be known among the faculty for my dating life.

I raised this issue with my supervisor, without the intention of taking it any further, but I wanted her advice as a woman in academia. She convinced me to let her email their supervisors ""to remind them of proper conduct"" and described their treatment of an ""unnamed female student"". She didn't name me, but they figured it out. They confronted me after class and asked my why I would report their “silly joke“. Apparently, their supervisors are now very cold towards them and less interested in helping. It’s not a formal complaint - only their supervisors know - but one of them, C, said his supervisor writes the reports for his financial aid/scholarship and it was my fault if he lost out on that.

I now feel a bit embarrassed and this was compounded by a friend telling me I took it to far cause C shouldn't lose out on his scholarship. So, reddit - AITA?

I remember back then asking how it was strange. Her mom was loved and Nigel and his late wife's family likely didn't want the kids to not know they were loved by their mom. She said that was her job now. I told her it wasn't healthy to feel that jealous and put out over a mom being remembered. Think of how she would feel if our mom died.

Honestly, I had a lot of respect for Nigel for the first two or three years because his kids seemed to be his priority and he seemed to still love and care about his late wife and not want to erase her but was also ready to be married to someone else. I had seen a lot of far more awful scenarios. But then he started letting my sister push herself onto the kids and try to force out their maternal relatives. It was very clear my sister blamed the maternal relatives for neither of her stepkids coming to think of her as their mom. She didn't want to hear any other reason it could be.

Now both of her stepkids are adults and her stepson became a father for the first time in January. His daughter is named after both her grandmother's. But his mom's name is her first name. My sister was so unhappy about that. She told him it was disrespectful to her and all that crap. He told her to go fuck herself and told her she still hadn't figured out that she wasn't his mom, she wasn't his parent, she wasn't even his real family, because he would happily dump her out of his life for good and would never feel bad about that.

My sister bitched for weeks about it and then I told her if I was her stepkid, I'd do the same. That she had no respect for his mom and had no respect for his maternal family. She freaked out and told me that was a shitty thing to say and I should be on HER side, because she's my SISTER.

We live very close to each other and I accompany them on their walks a few times a week. Emily likes to act like she and her dog are having actual conversations, which is fine at home, but weird in public. I asked her a few times before not to do it on our walks, but she just finds it funny.

Yesterday we sit down on a bench in the park in the middle of our walk and her dog wanted us to continue walking so he was grunting at us. Emily took this as an opportunity to pretend to have a conversation with him.

By conversation I mean something like this:

Emily: XY said this to me yesterday, can you imagine?

Dog: grunts 

Emily: Right?! That's what I said too.

Dog: grunts

Emily: I'm so happy you are on my side... and so on, and so on.

People walking by us were laughing at us and I asked Emily to stop, but she didn't. So I told her it's embarrassing and left her there.

Our mom died and we were raised by our father. I think our dad did a pretty shitty job at raising us, he wasn't there much, made us move a lot and had a dangerous job he kinda trained us into. My brother worshipped the man and always defended him which pissed me off, cause like the man always traited him like a good little soldier so he should be mad, right? Despite that, my brother was the one who was always here to protect me and raise me and even though he made mistakes I'm grateful for him and I love him. 

My dad wanted us both to follow his footsteps, saying the job was important and that he wanted us to stay in the family business. My brother agreed and never really invested himself in school and he eventually dropped out of high school. I had no intention of staying in this business forever, and while my family knew that, I don't think they ever took that seriously. A few months ago, I applied to college and eventually got a full ride. I didn't tell my brother about it because i knew he would have told my dad, and my dad would have been pissed. 

But at some point I had to leave for college and I thought it wouldn't be fair to just dip without explanation. I told my dad first, because while he would have the worst reaction, I cared about my brother's more than his. As planned, he got super mad. Told me I was damn ungrateful and everything. Not gonna go further into that, but my brother walked in on us and asked what was going on. My dad explained and then said that if i left, I would never be allowed to come back, that he would completely cut me out. I lowkey expected that. What I didn't expect was my brother to be completely silent about that, instead just telling me to stay and to ""not be stupid"". The job our dad does is important and saves a lot of people but I explained to him that I couldn't stay in this life and needed to find my own path. I just poured everything out and told him to come with me (we are pretty codependent since we grew up in each other's pocket and I knew getting away from him would hurt both of us). I could see he was torn but eventually he stayed loyal to our dad and that's when I picked up my backpack and went away. 

I knew at this point that my brother would never defend me against our dad, and that he would never support my decision to leave the family business. I love my brother and I feel bad for abandoning him. I know my dad isn't always kind to him and that the life we lived is pretty rough, so I'm worried about him.

They will be completing their basement a separate apartment in the summer. My fiance and I are looking to buy a home in our future and have a career change. We are making plans for this hypothetical situation where he will get another job in their area. We were all talking hypothetically about moving in there until the basement was completed. Which would have been no issues space wise when that was first introduced months ago. Unfortunately life happened to my other sil and she had to move back home and has yet to pay rent but has taken both extra rooms with an iou. 

My husband and I went to visit and the hypothetical situation was brought up and everyone is kind of under the impression just let it be until a decision actually has to be made. Obviously mil is under the opinion if one of her kids needs help she will do anything she can. But my youngest sil ( the one who just moved back and yet to pay for living there ) was of the opinion which she fully stated that because my fiance is a man and the oldest he should go and figure it out and his own and made comments that I took as degrading to him specifically. 

Anytime she needs help everyone is there to help her, and she couldn't find the same courtesy for her brother. After her opinions that he should be able to take care of his family on his own and shame him for wanting an easier path to success and stated that his family was the issue with him going there ( like my son and i are baggage and would contribute nothing). I simply told her she need not worry about having to sacrifice one of her two bedrooms because I will not be a part of living with her, I don't expect the courtesy to extend to my son and myself i have my own family i can go to if i need help but if her brother was having a hard time and needed help he shouldn't be shamed for it, and I would expect everyone in that home to help him like they help each other. Just because he's older shouldn't mean anything. I found her opinion entitled that she was the only one who could have a hard time and deserved understanding and support for her situation and I stated as such. We all needed up going home and I have 0 interest in really talking to her again unless she sees how absolutely  selfish she was being. 

My fiance agreed with me but I do feel bad for saying something when no one else was but I couldn't just let it slide. My fiance doesn't need someone to stand up for him but I know how hard he works and what he does for our family and I was extremely insulted for him even if he  just disregards what she says. I think people should be accountable.

"AITA for trying to bring my dog into my dorm for a few weeks?","YTA. Your dog your problem. Don’t make it your roommate problem.",2,0,66,66,"For some context, I (19F) live on campus in a townhouse with two other girls. This week, my mom has an urgent issue out of the country that she needs to leave for immediately (this Friday). She also has a dog that can't fly with her due to international restrictions, so he needs to stay with someone in the US. He is very loyal and doesn't really listen to anyone else but my mom. Also being a former stray, he's not the best with strangers.

The best option would be for him to stay with me. So, I asked my roommates if it was okay if I brought the dog to stay with us for two weeks. One of them clearly said yes. My other roommate (PY) wasn't as clear. She said that she had allergies and that she was also slightly scared of dogs so she didn't really want one to stay with us but said, if there isn't another option then it's ok. I took that as a maybe and told my mom as such, go look somewhere else and the dog should only come here if there are really no other options.

Fast forward to last night, my mom calls me saying there are really no other options and that the dog has to stay with me. I told my mom that my roommate's allergic and also scared but mom said to ask anyway. So I woke her up (she was asleep). I said ""I'm really sorry to put you in a hard spot but my dog has no where else to go, I know you aren't the most okay with that so is there anything I can do?"" PY wasn't giving me a straight answer when I asked that and more questions, I thought she was just tired. I offered to keep the dog downstairs and away from her. He wouldn't bother her as long as she ignored him and I would be doing all the care. After a bit of back and forth, she said ok, so I thanked her and apologized again then left to call my mom.

A family friend and her drove for a few hours to get to my dorm (I'm out of state) and got the dog all set up with supplies and food for the stay. Right before they're about to leave, the RA for our dorm shows up and says that the dog can't be left here as residential policy doesn't allow pets and that I'm making PY uncomfortable. I tried to explain that there aren't any options left and that PY said sure last night but the RA just said that there are no exceptions to the policy and that it was uncool of me to keep him here always but we could talk to the director. So the three of us went to see the director and right outside saw PY standing there. She was avoiding eye contact and quickly also left after the RA something to her.

I was pissed at her; I thought she was okay with it, but no she wasn’t and instead of coming to me she just went to the RA. My mom and her friend said that she was being rude and cowardly. I thought similarly but I also thought I might have missed something, forced her to say yes under stress, or something like that to make her feel that way to speak to somebody else. If that's the case, then I fucked up real bad.

If there needs to be more info, I’ll gladly elaborate.

UPDATE: Yea I think its clear that I'm TA here. Thank you everyone for your opinions, some of them hurt quite a bit but, that's to be expected when you post your dumbass-ry for the internet to judge. I'll apologize to her in the morning when she's awake. As for the 'her' post that's been floating around, I don't recognize the user but the situation is too uncanny.

"AITA for telling my stepson to start fighting back against bullies?","YTA just because you shouldn't be telling kids to use retard as a slur. There's so many other insults that you can employ, try to avoid the ones with baggage attached (it should go without saying but don't encourage gay, trans, or racial slurs). 

I don't necessarily think it's wrong to give advice to a kid on this, but I would say only if they ask for it.  If they ask for advice, I don't think it's overstepping paternal boundaries.  But sometimes it can be hard to recognize if someone wants help/advice or if someone wants to just vent. 

Perhaps a better option all around would be working to increase your stepson's confidence. Martial arts is a great option, but if he's not athletically inclined, there's still a ton of things you could look into.",10,0,13,13,"My stepson Bob (13M) has issues with being bullied in school. Thankfully no physical aggression, but bullies are making fun of him, calling him offensive names, etc. Bob is a very good kid, but he is a bit socially awkward, he is shy and doesn't like to talk a lot. He actually reminds me of myself because I had these exact issues when I was his age. His mother and I have been living together for 3 years, and she has full custody of Bob, so he lives with us full-time. In that time I've grown a bond with him and I consider him like a son to me.

Yesterday me and Bob were watching TV in the evening. My girlfriend comes home from work a bit later, so we were alone in the house. I asked Bob how was his day, and he shared with me that kids in school were being mean to him again. That's when I decided that just talking with the teachers isn't enough (because they obviously aren't doing anything about it), and we need to try a different approach. I told him that whenever someone insults him, he should hit back with a similar insult. For example, if someone tells him that he is retarded, Bob should say ""Shut up (bully name), You are the biggest retard I've seen."". It may seem silly, but in my experience after a few of these exchanges bullies realize they can't push around the victim anymore and they lose interest. I used this exact ""strategy"" as a kid to fight back against bullies and it worked out perfectly.

As we were having this conversation, my girlfriend came home from work and apparently overheard a part of our conversation. She asked me to go to our room so we can talk. She was very angry and told me that I was giving Bob incredibly bad advice, that this can get him into even more trouble, etc. She also told me that ""I had no right"" to give such advice without first discussing it with her. We got into a huge fight and I actually went to sleep at a friend's house. We have never had such a huge fight before and I am not sure on what to do going forward.

But both mom and brother are for sure.",2021,0,2930,2930,"I (23F) am a college student and live with my mom and brother “Caden” (21M). Caden is very obsessed with seeming masculine, and he takes a lot of pride in his personal style. He has a decent following on YouTube  and TikTok, and his “brand” is basically about being a player and attracting girls.

Well, he was making a video yesterday with some fairly expensive jeans he copped from a local custom designer. They are light pink and he was having trouble finding a shirt to match. He came out to the kitchen complaining, and I told him to wear this tee I got for his birthday last month. I told him the pattern had some pink in it and would match well with pink jeans.

Caden immediately started yelling and kicking off. He insisted that they weren’t pink, and accused me of gaslighting him. He said they were red and I just had an agenda of masculating him. These jeans are literally rose pink, so I was definitely not gaslighting him.

He called our mom at work (this was during her lunch hour) and told her what I said. My mom took Caden’s side and accused me of raining on my brothers parade by making him feel bad about his new clothes. I replied that I don’t think guys wearing pink is bad, and Caden is just making drama over nothing.

Now Caden won’t wear the jeans, and because they aren’t returnable, my mom wants me to reimburse him the cost of the jeans. There’s no way I’m doing that.

Background:

I joined a corporate office for the first time in my life this year (3 months currently at the organisation), in the past i have only been working in small design and art studios, I am a visualizer/illustrator btw. Anyway I was quite overwhelmed as the office is full of people, about 3000 in the entire building i think.

Story-

A couple of days after my joining this petite girl approaches me asks if i smoke, I was like hell yeah i found someone to pass my breaks with and just happy to make my first friend here. She works in the other department so we have no reason to mingle with each-other so I was happy she made a move and tried to make me comfortable. We hung-out with each-other for about a month, it was fun she was very outspoken, a little rude but over all it seemed she thought she was better than everyone lol.

I always texted her on our break, but she only responded when she was in the ""mood"" very soon i realised she only cared to talk when she felt like it. One day I was hanging with some of my other colleagues and she barged into the circle looked dead into the eyes of other colleagues and said ""today only we will go for a walk and no one else"", mind you she did not even glance at me once while saying this. This made me feel a little weird and excluded but i let it go, a couple of days later she completely stopped looking at me. I stopped texting her to hang in the breaks and she has not spoken a word to me since then.

I cross her now without acknowledging her at all, i say hello and good morning to all teams and people seem to know me now in the office and everyone asks what happened to my ""friend"" and i just say I dont know, i guess she is not in the ""mood"" the point is I was not okay with being an option to ""hang"" so AITA for not even asking her whats up? why she is behaving this way? I just dont want to deal with such childish behaviour at work. Should I ask her?

"AITA for refusing to buy a new television until the old one breaks?","YTA.",1,0,4,4,"My wife and I have owned our television set for about ten years.  There are signs that it is beginning to fail.  Every once in a while, the screen turns purple, and we have to turn it off and back on again to get it back to normal.  My wife says that these problems are only going to get worse and that we should buy a new TV soon, but I checked the prices, and they are ridiculous.  Even worse, she wants a top-of-the-line TV, which is going to set us back even more money.  I have told her that we need to wait for our current TV set to break before even considering buying a new one.

Yesterday evening, we were watching TV, and one of the speakers just stopped working.  I tried hitting the TV, thinking it was an electrical short, but it never came back on.  My wife went into full ""I told you so"" mode and said that we wouldn't be having this problem with the audio if we had already purchased a new TV.  I told her that she was being spoiled and entitled and that one of the speakers was still working, so we could simply increase the volume to compensate.  She became really angry at me, calling me a cheapskate and saying that TV is really important to her as a way to unwind from a hard day at work.

I absolutely resent being called a cheapskate, and I told her that I thought she was struggling to control her emotions and saying things that she really didn't mean.  I told her that I wouldn't have purchased a premium gaming laptop for myself if I was so cheap, and I suggested that she relax and take some deep breaths.  She told me that I was being condescending and unhelpful.  I told her that it was her decision to feel so emotional about this and that I was unwilling to continue the conversation until she could calm down and start being logical.  She accused me of being sexist, stormed off, and slammed the bedroom door shut.  I just want my wife to understand that money doesn't grow on trees and that she's being unreasonable about the situation, but she seems completely unwilling to empathize with my point of view.  She's been distant this morning and barely said two words to me before leaving for work.  AITA?

My daughter (10) wanted a puppy for her birthday so my wife and I went to a shelter and picked a puppy for her, we made it very clear that she had to be responsible for it. That means that she'll have to clean after him, feed him and checking his water bowl, etc. We would hire a trainer and would take him to the vet when it was needed, but besides that she had to take care of it. 

During the first month things were okay, she did as she promised. But now (over two months since she got the puppy) she complains about having to clean when the dog poops or pees on the floor and when she had to take care of him. This week she reached the last straw because she forgot to give him water, my wife had to fill his bowl because she didn't do it. 

I told her this is enough because a dog is not a toy and she promised to be responsible. I contacted some friends/ family and asked them if they wanted the puppy. Finally a coworker said she wanted it and I took him to her house. 

My daughter is very sad now but I think she needs to learn a lesson here. My parents told me I was being unfair because deep down I knew that my daughter was gonna fail in being responsible and I set her up for failure. They think that as a dad I need to teach them but not punish them the first time they make a mistake. Are they right?

"AITA for calling my mom selfish","If the market is good you should be able to sell, and she should of course get the majority of the profit as she put up the investment. You should of course offer her the option of buying you out if she wants to keep it

INFO: how did you get to 40%?",2,0,5,5,"I am 31 female and around 6 years ago my long term bf cheated on me. We lived together and it was a terrible situation. My mom suggested we purchase a condo for me to live in since she will be selling her house. I was thankful for the support bc at the time I was living with my cheater ex and finding somewhere to live was difficult. 

Fast forward, I ended up finding a condo within the budget and have been living here for the past 6 years. My mom put in a down payment of around 29k. She is on the loan but my name was added to the title as a co-owner. 

FYI My mom doesn’t contribute towards the loan payment /monthly HOA fee/insurance/taxes/maintenance/improvements for the condo. 

Here’s where things took a turn. My fiancé and I are trying to buy a home this year. We don’t have the amount saved required for a 20% down payment. I was approved for a USDA no down payment loan but the terms sucked and the rate was high. It just didn’t make financial sense to do. 

My mom and I have always talked about renting the condo out for when I was ready to move out. But now, I am thinking it’s better to sell for a few reasons 

1. The market is good right now in this area and the comps look promising for a good return on the investment
2. Our HOA is unstable. Many of the owners don’t want to spend the money to keep the place above standards. Things are falling a part. There are many large projects that will be coming which equals large assessments. I was on the board for the past 6 years as VP and it’s been a nightmare dealing with our neighbors
3. If we were to rent we would only make around 400.00 each month. It’s not enough for me to want to deal with a renter, any issues or complaints, and be a landlord overall. 
4. We aren’t able to Airbnb 

My plan would be to sell the condo, pay back my mom her down payment plus 40% of the profit we made from selling. 

I have invested 13k in paying down the loan thus far and I renovated the kitchen which was around 14k total. I plan to invest another 10-12k in renovations of the flooring, bathroom and adding a washer/dryer hookup. 

When I asked her what she thought she just told me no like I was a child. I asked her why and her answer was simply she doesn’t know what’s going to happen in the future and she may want to live in the condo. She also said my fiancé and I aren’t married yet so she doesn’t want me buying a house with him. Not sure why that matters but I did tell her it would be just me on the house loan. We want my fiancés credit to be clear so we can buy an investment property in the future. 

Ultimately the conversation got heated and she said I was a bad person and I am selfish. I told her she was being selfish as well. 

I have always told her she would have a place to stay with us. I also told her she could use her profit from the sale to invest in another condo in a better area for her. She doesn't like big cities and is a very anxious person. 

Anyways sorry for the long post but AMIA?

They let their dogs roam free and they have stolen things and torn up things around my house. To say I don’t like my neighbors is an understatement. 

The past week I’ve had an uncollared dog pay me visits during the day and night. I gave him food and I shit you not he ate and entire big bowl of food in about 2 minutes(that’s no exaggeration). He is so skinny you can see his hip bones, tips of his vertebrae, and all his ribs. The way he acts is textbook abuse. Last night he came for food and I could hear someone yelling outside. When I wen out on my porch Doc Brown (I named the stray dog that) was gone and the yelling was coming from my neighbor. This morning I woke up and walked out to my car when I could hear Doc whining from across the pasture. It made my heart ache. I looked through a rifle scope I have and saw that they keep him in just a 6x6 kennel with no bed, house or bowls of water and food. He was up against the fence facing my direction just yelping. So I decided when I get home today and he escapes again I’m going to bring him inside and shelter him till I can take him to my farm and let him live there with all the shelter, water and food he could ever want. 

The only thing is I know it’s wrong to take someone else’s dog but these people are mistreating him so badly and I can’t stand it. There are no animal shelters just a local humane society run by some older people and that it’s. No cop here is gunna care about a dog so I feel I need to step up and help Doc out. 

WIBTA here?

Edit 1. A lot of people have told me to call the local PD. People from very rural areas know that local cops are pretty much useless in a situation like this. They know everyone and my neighbors will know I called. What makes me nervous about them knowing it’s me is my two rescued hound dogs. They could shoot them and claim ignorance or do something to them. Local cops are as useless as tits on a boar hog. 

Edit 2. People that are commenting who are from city outskirts or the city themselves. In a area that has only 400 people living here there is no pound or animal control. If there is dead animals on the side of the road or in the road they stay there till buzzards eat them or maggots do. There is a local humane society but it’s two people that run it and I’ve already called and they can’t do anything since it’s an owned dog.

I mean, it's food if the person in question doesn't want to eat that, don't force him and that's it, the poor girl being harassed and the mother putting her against the wall because her culture is more important than her mental health, yes I know that the problem is not the food but these bullies will not stop and the school will not do anything, in the end only the girl is left alone with her bullies, OP you do the right thing NTA",1,0,4439,4439,"My wife Sara (36F) and I (35M) have an 11 year old daughter named Lily. Lily had begun attending 6th grade in September, but this problem only recently became a major issue. Sara is Indian and makes great dishes that the whole family enjoys, and tends to pack these lunches for Lily as well. She typically packs Lily a rice with dal in a container or something similar, which she had no issues with in elementary school.

However, recently Lily came sobbing to her mom and I about the lunches she took. The kids at school had been making fun of her food, which absolutely made my heart break. I had struggled with the same thing at her age (I come from a Chinese family and would always take homemade food to school too) and when I asked her if she wanted us to report the problem, she begged us not to so she wouldn't be called a ""snitch"" or worse. When Sara heard this, she simply contacted the principal, which I didn't want to resort to at first, and left the issue, telling Lily she wouldn't be buying school lunch and to just ignore the other kids.

The same problem occured every day, Lily would be coming home feeling extremely upset and there were even times Sara would yell at Lily for not even touching her school lunch. We both had talks with Lily about her culture and how she should be proud, have contacted the schools, but the school is ignorant of the issue (they simply had a talk with the parents, and ended it there) and Lily isn't budging. I don't want her to starve, because so many days she doesn't even eat her lunch. I know how brutal middle schoolers can be, and I didn't want Lily to feel insecure or upset even if it meant making her take other lunches, but Sara refuses to make other lunches.

I began to make other lunches for Lily, like sandwiches, or sometimes mac n' cheese, so she'd feel more comfortable eating it in school in front of her classmates as a final resort when nothing else worked. I would take Lily's lunch for myself at work and pack her own lunch early in the morning, which she finished and seemed happier when coming home daily after. However, this only worked for about 2 weeks until Sara found out and was infuriated. She said I was denying Lily her culture and she needed to learn to stop being insulted by other kids, telling me I'm raising Lily to get whatever she wants. Is Sara right? AITA?

EDIT: Bringing this post and topic up tonight, I'll post an update when I can. Hopefully this is enough to convince Sara- if not, I'll do what other comments said and just keep packing Lily's lunch or let her pick.

Lol",1,0,510,510,"Recently, we had a birthday party for my (32f) son (7m) He invited some of his classmates and our neighbour's kids who he's close with. One of them was a 12-year-old boy who brought a doll-type thing which glowed and made noises if you pressed a button. We opened the present later after the party, and even though my son was happy to receive it, I noticed that the toy had a cracked shoulder.

The next day, when the boy came to play with my son and the other kids, I asked him who brought the gift, and he said he did it. I showed him the broken part and lightly scolded him. I simply told him that if he was going to spend money buying something, he should've checked the thing. I gave it back to him and told him to ask the store to replace it since it's broken. I thought it was a good life lesson and that he'd remember this. It would help him when he buys something later on. It would teach him not to waste his money.

However, later that evening his mom called me and told me that I was very rude to her son. She said and I quote ""if someone gives you a gift, you just appreciate it and don't say anything even if it's not that good, especially when it's a kid"" Turns out, he bought it with his own pocket money, and he put a lot of thought into it. He did replace the gift, but he has stopped coming to play with my son. AITA? I genuinely didn't mean to upset him. I didn't even really scold him.

When talking about my financial aid, my mom was constantly talking about how she was gonna take it from my account (we had a shared account at the time as I had just turned 18 a couple months before this) and how she would send me money every week or basically as she saw fit. I was uncomfortable with this as she has made my sister take out loans to pay for their Disney vacation and use her aid to buy her new sewing machine to which my dad had to pay her back both times. I tried to say something at first but she quickly shut it down. After talking to my sister and dad, they advised me to make my own account for the money to go to. I felt bad but didn’t want to say anything to my mom as it would make her mad and I didn’t want to be made to switch it back. She kept talking about it and I said nothing about my plan (keep in mind not saying anything was advised by my sister and dad). But Rhee and my dad were planning a trip to the mountains and the closer the time came for them to book the place, mom talked more and more about my aid and asking me if it had came in yet. The day it came in I had gone to work with my dad so I planned on telling her that night to which my dad agreed with. An hour after she got to work she called me saying she had called the people in the financial aid department and they told her the money had been sent out already. (She works at the university) so I told her it had just gotten deposited in the bank and she asked what bank cause she didn’t see it to which I told her it was in my bank that I had made. She was fuming and didn’t talk to me for awhile and said how much i was a terrible person for lying to her and not saying anything when she talked about it and so on. My dad and sister both claimed to have nothing to do with it and didn’t want to get involved even after me telling them I felt bad about it. She went and cried to her in laws and as a narcissist she told the story in a way that made her the victim. So AITA for not letting her manage my money?

Tell the daughter you'll consider it, then when the baby is born, name it what you want. You don't need to put so much effort in placating a CHILD. 

My oldest was 7 and wanted us to name a baby ""Violet."" We told him it was a lovely name. When we came home and the baby had a different name, we told him that when she came out, we really felt the other name suited her. It's a year later, and everyone's fine. 

Your BIL is ridiculous and you are NTA.",1,0,926,926,"My husband's older brother Tom is married to Valerie. Valerie has an 8 year old daughter who Tom adopted last year. Valerie and Tom are expecting another baby together. Their daughter had suggestions for names for her baby brother or sister. Namely names that were nature themed (Wren, Dove, Lark, River, Hawthorn, Forrest, Cove, Ocean). My name is actually among one she suggested. My own brother has a bird name along with me lol. Tom proceeded to tell his daughter that those were not real names and that I had always disliked/hated my name and they didn't want their little baby to be the same. He said this in front of me and my husband. My husband thought he was crazy and told him I had never said that. Tom glared at my husband. Then his daughter asked me if I hated my name and I said I didn't. Valerie said it didn't really matter what I thought, but they didn't want their kid to have a weird name and she told their daughter they wanted baby to have a lovely name like she has. Their daughter said she liked my name better and didn't think her name was nice. My husband and Tom's parents were like, let's not insult other people's names when Tom and Valerie started to protest and reminded them that they were in the presence of someone with one of the so called ""ridiculous names"".

Fast forward on a couple of hours and Tom came over and told me I needed to tell his daughter that names like mine do not work on people and that I want her to stop wanting a sibling called that and start embracing her name and the name they will give her future sibling. He told me just because I wanted to live like a freak with a weird ass name didn't mean he wanted that for his kids.

I told him he was a lying asshole for putting words in my mouth and expecting me to do the same. I told him nobody said he needed to like my name, but to insult it, to insult me and then ask me to lie with him was unbelievable. I told him I didn't need to lie for him and wouldn't and to get out of my fucking face.

My husband and I left almost immediately after, apologizing for leaving abruptly to my ILs and to our niece. Tom called my husband after and said his daughter could have heard and I was an asshole for saying what I did to him when she was in the house.

"AITA for ditching my friend and her toddler at a restaurant because they were late?","NTA

Is there a reason she can’t communicate with you that she’s running behind? 

Of course you don’t expect her to put you over her kid. Even those who are childless understand that’s not reasonable, but you aren’t wrong for expecting her to be considerate of you and your friendship either. 

It kind of sounds like you two may be outgrowing your friendship. That’s ok some people are only meant to be part of your life for a little bit not the whole time. It’s also not her child’s fault, but more so your friends for not being able to see the world beyond her own needs.",53,0,5772,5772,"My friend (""Samantha"") is a stay-at-home mom and has a four-year-old daughter (""Katie""). Since her daughter's birth, she always insisted that I go to her place if I ever wanted to hang out. Even though she lives about 45 minutes away from me, I always did it in the beginning because I did value our friendship, and Katie was her first, so I could understand how she'd be stressed with a newborn.

Recently, I started to put my foot down and wanted her to meet me halfway. I felt like her kid (she only has Katie) was old enough to handle being outside and I was tired of driving just to hang at her house. We always picked a place halfway, so I felt like it was doable. 

During the last three hangouts, she was over 30 minutes late, and each time she claimed that she got ""mom privileges"" for being late because she had to wrangle her kid into the car and do other ""mom things"" I wouldn't understand (according to her. I'm childless). 

She asked to hang out this past weekend, and I told her that if she was late again, I'd leave. Lo and behold, the day came and she was late. After 30 minutes, I got up and left, but went to hang in the coffeeshop across the street because I was curious just how late she'd be. She was over an hour late, and when she found out from the waitress that I left, she started to call and text me. 

She said that I was callous and selfish for making her drive 25 minutes away from home with a toddler only to leave, and that she only ever came out for my benefit. I told her that I hang out with multiple friends who bring their kids out with us, and they're never late, so it was pretty shitty to blame being late on Katie (who is a perfectly sweet girl. She's never been a problem during our outings). Samantha just kept pulling the ""you're not a mom so you wouldn't get it"" card. 

I heard later from a mutual friend that Samantha has been blasting me in their mommy group and said I was bullying her for putting her child first. I feel like her reaction wouldn't be so strong unless she was actually upset, so I'm starting to kind of feel like an AH. I mean, she's right that I don't ""get it"" as I don't have children, but I still feel annoyed that she's late and feel justified for leaving. My time is precious too!

SIL is Sophie, she’s 26F and married to my husband’s brother. I’m 29F.

Sophie has been married to my BIL since late 2021. Whenever we have had holidays she has spent it with her family, and my husband and I only go back to his hometown during the holidays - so I don’t know her well.

Anyway we have a holiday coming up in just over a month. For the first time Sophie’s parents will be away so she will be celebrating with us.

That’s all background. As is the fact that my MIL is a trained patissier. I promise it’s relevant.

I happened to be in town this week and MIL started putting together her list of ingredients for the stuff she will make. She was consulting me, and my husband’s sister Zara, about what to make and also delegated a couple of things to each of us.

Sophie came into the living room and said “oh I can definitely make better brownies, tartlets and whatever else than [my name]!”

Now my MIL takes desserts very seriously. I said okay you can make that stuff but MIL said no we need to have the nicest sweets. There was a back and forth and Sophie suggested what I can only describe as a bake off.

So we made brownies, tiramisu, lemon meringue and the family judged between us and everyone voted in my favour. 

Sophie got mad at me and said I’d hidden the fact that I know how to bake from her to which Zara said neither of us really bake when MIL is around because she’s amazing but that we both *can* if we need to.

Now Sophie is mad at me for both hiding my ability from her and for purposefully embarrassing her in front of our in laws. I think she’s stupid - she wanted the silly bake off right up until she lost, it’s not my fault she has an ego

I F30 have history with groom, we had the same friendship group in early teens and twenty. This friendship group imploded, when I had to take my ex to court for a number of reasons reddit will not allow me to post. (I won in court, he was charged and have restraining order).

During this time I suffered from ptsd and anorexia, it took a long time to rebuild my life. Some of the group took his side and were not happy I was taking it to court. F1 would repeatedly harass me blocking my car in, threatening me and turn up where I was, including my house at all hours of the night. In the end I had to tell her, I would also take her to court if she did not back off. She backed off. 

The wedding is this year I was asked to be bridesmaid and happily accepted. 6 months later I see a post that my sister has asked F1 to be a bridesmaid. I feel disrespected and that I do not feel comfortable with this person. Please note the bridal party was meant to get ready at my house and there's no way F1 is setting foot in my house. I don't want to be bridesmaid but my parents say I should keep the peace. I will still go to the wedding and support my sister, but want nothing to do with f1. I am not asking my sister to choose, just that I want to back out as bridesmaid. So WIBTA for breaking the peace?

Edit 
I could write many books about my toxic family, sister is golden child, I'm the black sheep, if I think something is wrong I say it (I'm not the peace keeper).

Me, groom, ex and f1 were in the same group of friends.

Sister and family know about history with F1! Sister is only friends with F1 coz groom.

My husband and I have been married for almost 2 years. His ex-wife was a princess who never worked or contributed to the family but spent lavishly on herself. We both work but I make more money than he does and he is still paying the huge legall fees from his divorce but we have been splitting all our joint living expenses 50/50. Last year we got a $5000 refund from our joint tax return. We use my accountant so all the filings and returns go through me. For the same tax year I made a mistake on my elderly mothers tax return that cost  her almost $5000. I felt bad so I gave her our joint refund but didn't tell my husband we had gotten a refund nor that I was keeping it for my mom. He recently had a small financial windfall from an airline that thought they lost his luggage but really didn't. He used the money to pay me back money he owed me but i feel as though half that money should be mine anyway. When we argued about that he asked about our tax refund and i reluctantly him the truth. Now he is angry and says I'm like his ex-wife who always thought what was theirs was hers and what was his was theirs and that he could have used his half of the refund to pay some of his legal expenses. My mom is 93 and has savings plus an income from a job as well as social security but has high rent expenses.  So I think I was in the right. Also even though it was his luggage and he did all the legwork to get a refund from the airline I feel it was like winning the lottery so we should have shared the money.

He said everyone in his family was telling him he should be happy because he wouldn't have to listen to his parents fight anymore and he should be happy they're divorcing. Kai said he wasn't.

Most of the time I have to make sure none of my stuff has been broken or stolen and to never ever buy snacks for myself with my money because that stuff will be gone. I also get to hear about them getting suspended from school every time I'm at my dad's.

So I got a lecture and was told I was wrong and acting like a spoiled kid. I decided to just go to my mom's and not listen. Dad told me I should never have told Kai what I did.

Wah wah. Dump him - he needs a mama not a partner. NTA.",7,0,379,379,"Hi everyone! I apologize in advance for my poor english.

I (26F) have been with my boyfriend (32M) for 5 years.

He works longer hours than me, so he usually is home at 8:30-9PM.
Yesterday I was working from home. I had a really rough day due to an endometriosis crisis (at some point I couldn't stand up). I try not to take medecine everyday because they are strong morphinic painkillers.

I finished working at 5, and then went to get some groceries, put the laundry in the machine and cooked the dinner. As my boyfriend wasn't home, I put his dish into the fridge and ate mine.

When he got home, he was kinda grumpy. I was in bed because I was again hurting a lot. He told me to bring him water and his meal. I reply I couldn't because of the cramps. He told me :""fine, then I won't eat and I will be thirsty, I have a stomachache too you know"".

I told him to get the dish from the fridge and just reheat it, but he wouldn't and just said :""Ok so when I ask for water and some food, I just can't get it, understood."" Then he told me he will not come back next week because I treated him poorly (he owns an appartment).

We've had arguments over everything from the color of the bridesmaid dresses to the type of flowers we're using.

But the biggest disagreement we've had so far is about her boyfriend (37M). They've only been dating for a few months, and I don't feel comfortable having him at my wedding. It's a small affair, and we only invited people who we are close with and who have been a part of our lives for a long time. We didn't want to invite any strangers or people we barely know.

When I told my sister she couldn't bring her boyfriend, she was absolutely livid. She accused me of being selfish and not caring about her happiness. She even threatened to not come to the wedding at all if he couldn't come.

I calmly explained my concerns, but I told her I wouldn't compromise on this. It's my wedding day, and I want to be surrounded by people who I love and who have been there for me throughout my life. I feel like if I give in and let her bring her boyfriend, it will set a bad precedent for our relationship going forward.

now anyway my wife showed me the home and we went down her sister who is an all around repairman to see if anything is wrong with the home, and her mom who wanted to see the home, now everything is going great then we find out why its so cheap. and the reason was because the previous owner offed herself and her kids.

that's when the problem starts because you see, her mom believes in ghost and all of a sudden she start sensing something. she said that buying this home would be a horrible idea, and unfortunately my wife kind of always listen to her mom and even though she was all for buying it she changed her mind

and look i try to respect other peoples beliefs, ghost, and sprits are stupid, and im not going to pass on this offer over something like a silly belief. I mean its my money that i inherited, and we could have a home were we could have a child.

I talked to her sister about it who doesn't fall for that stuff, and doesn't put up with her mothers crap, and she said she would be willing to sign with me and pretend to be wife on the papers we would have to fill out, I'm considering doing it but i want to know what aita thinks, so aita

"AITA for leaving my friends party after they expected their guests to pay for drinks?","NTA - Maybe I'm a little elitist here, but that's just reality.  You can't pay for a party, you don't throw a party.  It's ridiculous enough that they drink for free at other people's parties but want everyone to bring their own drink to their own party, but this whole thing about selling those drinks for profit at your own party is way beyond petty.  This goes beyond poverty of money, it is poverty of spirit.  I find it extremely ridiculous that people who are broke will throw parties and party without having money, if you're poor be content with what you can afford.",5,0,6647,6647,"This past weekend my wife (41F) I (42M) attended one of my friends party's that I was invited to. For context my friend (42M) his gf (48F) and their two friends (also mid 40's M&F) were hosting this party the **4 of them together.**

A few weeks ago when I received the invitation I realized that it said on it something along the lines of ""please be prepared to purchase your own drinks"". Didn't think much of it at the time considering I just thought they were hiring a bar tender or something, but fast forward to the day of the party.

I arrive with my wife and it's my friend and his gf standing behind their kitchen counter that they were using as their ""bar"", making/charging the guests for drinks. Now I was confused for a few reasons...

1, the fact that this party was held at my friends house, it's not like this was at an event space or something where this would be normal imo. 2, there was no bar tender that they hired or anything like that. It was literally 2 of the 4 of them standing in the kitchen at a time making drinks for people and then charging them accordingly (drinks were all under $10).

Now idk if this is actually a common thing, but I have never in my 42 years of living been to a ""party"" at a friends house where the hosts are charging you themselves for drinks.

I've had multiple parties over the years, that I have invited my friend and his gf to in which they have attended, and I've never charged **ANYONE** for drinks ever. I've always bought all the drinks myself and had an open bar type of situation. Where my guests can make there own drinks. I even had a proper bar tender once and still no one was charged, it was an open bar.

I honestly felt like my friend, his gf and their friends were all trying to make a quick buck off of their guests who attended. Clearly to cover to cost of the drinks. Which yeah I understand that booze isn't cheap these days but we're talking splitting the cost of whatever they bought between **4 PEOPLE**. Like in my opinion if you can't afford to supply drinks at your party, why are you having a party in the first place?

This also wasn't for charity or anything the money made off of the drinks was for them to split.

My wife and I bought one drink each, stayed for about an hour or so, and said our goodbyes. When we were leaving my friend asked why we didn't have that much to drink? I told him because I think it's ridiculous that they are charging their close friends for drinks. He called me cheap and an unsupportive friend. I assured him that i'm not, if the charging of drinks was for a good cause (like profits go to charity or something) of course i'd buy drinks.

I told him I find the fact that they are charging for drinks, and keeping the money for themselves ridiculous and taking advantage of their friends. Anyway now my friend and his gf are butt hurt about this and have been calling me an AH to our mutual friends. AITA here?

(EDIT: Wow! I did not expect this post to blow up like this but thank you guys.

To be honest it’s time your parents accepted the entire world doesn’t have to accept her shitty behaviour. And they haven’t manage to handle her before so I doubt they will now. Stick to your guns. Your twin basically wants to be a homophobic a*hole and get away with it because ‘well I’m honest when I’m drunk’.",1,0,993,993,"For a little context me and my twin “Mary” are 25. We grew up close but over the years she took a different path and got lost in drugs and alcohol addiction and we just became distant. I tried to help as much as I could but  learned someone who doesn’t want help won’t accept help. My parents have always favored her and that’s another reason our relationship isn’t as strong. Over the last year I’d say we began speaking again and aren’t super close but it’s better. 

The last time we spoke was about 2 years ago when she revealed to my entire family that I was gay. It was at a dinner and she got completely trashed and said it without thinking and made more comments voicing her negative her negative opinions on the topic. My parents spoke and both cried like I ruined their lives which is another story but they’ve somewhat accepted that I won’t change. Which I can’t say about my sister. 

I have been with my fiancé F26 for about 4 years and we’re planning on getting married early spring. Although my sister has voiced her opinion on our relationship she still wanted to support and come to our wedding. Recently her and her bf M35 are both invited on the account that she is respectful. I’m not having a traditional MOH wedding party it’s more just my close friends m & f supporting me and helping but nothing too strict. My sister didn’t want to be involved so I didn’t involve her but we both agreed for her to have a speech.

We were sitting down drafting some ideas when she said is it ok if I put some jokes in it. I hesitated but said sure write them and I’ll look over them. When I read what she wrote I immediately told her no jokes: all she wrote was rude comments toward my fiancé and the majority of it was homophobic and saying shit like “it’s not a real wedding in Gods eyes so who cares”. I then told her explicitly to not comment on my relationship at all during the wedding. 

She argues that ofc she’s gonna voice her opinion bc she can’t control honesty when she’s drunk. I then say you’re not drinking then, I told her if she will not be respectful she doesn’t have to go. If she wants to go to humiliate me and my fiancé I don’t want her there. She then goes you can’t expect me to be quiet I mean you’re marrying a woman. The convo continued until I ultimately uninvited her. Now my parents are saying I’m being an AH and they won’t go either bc they aren’t going to support my actions if my sister isn’t going to be included. They say they will keep an eye on her but uninviting my twin sister to my “wedding” they put it in quotes is fucked up and I should be ashamed. I want my parents there bc I do want their support even if they aren’t 100% they have shown effort in getting to know my fiancé but I don’t trust my sister and if I don’t invite her they said they won’t go.

A married couple will occupy the master bedroom, and my current roommate and I will occupy the two smaller bedrooms, sharing a bathroom. I want to/am able to pay a higher portion of the rent, and in exchange I want the bigger of the two rooms

I \[24M\], my current roommate \[23M\] and our married best friends \[23M, 25F\] will be moving in together in 3 months, and are right now looking at rental homes to share. All of us, except for the 23M husband, have bachelors degrees. The husband will complete his bachelor's in 6 months.

In our current housing, we all have same sized rooms and pay equal shares of the rent. Right now we pay $430 per person, which is very cheap in our college town, but we have small houses. We want a bigger house, in a better area for jobs, and so we are aiming at $1700 to $2000

I make significantly more money than everyone else. I make $7400/month, my current roommate makes $2100/month, and the married couple make $1700 a month, though only one of them has a part-time job. I am the only one with a job in my major, though my friends are constantly looking for better jobs.

The married couple will pay a max of $850 for their share of the rent, my roommate wants to pay a max of $550, and I am comfortable paying much higher. 

For the higher-end houses in our range, the max I'd pay for them is $650, under the condition that I get the 2nd biggest of the 3 bedrooms. My roommate thinks it is not fair that I get a bigger bedroom than him, he tries arguing that I ""don't even use \[my\] bedroom that much"" and that he ""practically lives in \[his\] bedroom"" and therefore wants the bigger of the two rooms, as he would use it more. This is true, he is very much holed up in his room most of the non-working hours of the day, and I work from home, preferring to be in the living room where I can lay on the couch or turn on TV while I work. This is where I might be the asshole, as I really would be okay with taking the smaller of the two rooms.

However, my roommate is not willing to pay more for the room. He has been broke for a while, and is only recently able to save up for the move. Paying $550 is the max he would be able to afford on his income. I am not willing to pay more for a smaller room, which I believe is fair. If I don't get a bigger bedroom, then I'm willing to pay less, while my roommate is not willing to pay more, and therefore we cannot afford the higher-end houses in our range.

He says it feels like I'm keeping the nicer houses ""hostage"" just because I make more money. It's important to note that he has struggled with jealousy specifically regarding me and my successes for the past 2 years. It's something the whole group has noticed.

"TIL of Dr. Farrokhroo Parsa, physician, women's right's activist, and Pahlavi Iran's first female cabinet minister. She was executed for ""prostitution"" after the Islamic revolution: ""I am prepared to receive death with open arms rather than live in shame by being forced to be veiled.""","Reading some of the posts here, feels like there's a move to rehabilitate the Shah. Hopefully this is not a prelude to a regime change; the region doesn't need another Chalabi.

First of all, let's get this out of way: knowing nothing else about this woman, I think she's a brave, courageous person who got killed for working with the wrong side. This however, does not make ""her side"" (the Shah) ""good"". You can be against a bad mofo and disapprove the attacks against ""his side"" too. It's not an all-or-nothing proposition.

I think the Shah is a bad guy because he is a ruthless dictator who employs his secret police to torture and kill dissidents. Please note that me criticizing him **does not mean I approve of Khomeini and the subsequent regime** - it's the opposite. 


The stuff I'm going to put in my post have multiple sources, but I'm going to rely chiefly on *The Great War for Civilization - the Conquest of the Middle East* by Robert Fisk.

__________________

> (the Savak) *... was to become the most notorious and most murderous, its torture chambers among the Middle East's most terrible institutions. A permanent secret US mission was attached to Savak HQ. Methods of interrogation included - apart from the conventional electric wires attached to genitals, beating on the soles of the feet and nail extraction - rape and ""cooking"", the latter a self-explanatory form of suffering in which the victim was strapped to a bed of wire that was then electrified to become a red-hot toaster* (p120-121)

Of course, the Shah's ""regular"" law enforcement isn't any better:

> *in 1977, they* (the Red Cross) *were allowed to see more than three thousand ""security detainees"" - political prisoners - in eighteen different jails. They recorded that the inmates had been beaten, burned with cigarettes and chemicals, tortured with electrodes, raped, sodomised with bottles and boiling eggs. Interrogators forced electric cable into the uterus of female prisoners* (p.123)

Someone in the comments said something along the lines of ***""at least the Shah didn't force women to cover up""***. Bro, authoritarianism doesn't become ""better"" just because it's secular. 

As a closing thought, let me say this: it took the mechanisations of MI6 and the CIA to overthrow Mossadegh and install the Shah. There were no foreign counter-coup to put Khomeini. If the Shah is really the ""force of good"" that some of you think, then why did you think the Iranians reacted to violently against him?",3,0,4857,4857,NA,4857,"Felinomancy","mrhuggables",0

I realized I hadn’t eaten yet either, so I said hey, I’ll give you my card and If you go pick up the food, I will pay for your meal. Keep in mind this is an $8 fast food meal not a lobster dinner. Before she returned, I received a phone call from my GF, she was upset. Apparently she ran into Lee at at the restaurant. Lee had mentioned I had given her my card to buy us food. My GF said it made her uncomfortable that I was buying food for some other girl, and then she felt angry that her BF bought some other girl food, and then she had to pay for her own food by herself. I apologized, I did not mean to upset her. I said I see how that can make you feel uncomfortable. I just explain the convenience of the scenario. If I had known my GF would be there I would’ve happily paid for her meal as well. My GF seems to think that Lee told her about it just to rub her face in it. I don’t believe that, I think Leigh was just telling her what was happening. Lee overheard some of the call, and she said she felt awful. She apologized and offered to give me money for the meal. I told her that was not necessary, because neither of us did anything wrong, and my GF was overreacting. 

After work, I went over to see my GF. She was crying and said this made her feel like shit, and that she didn’t want to be in a relationship if I could make her feel this way. I apologized again and said that I understand her grievance, especially concerning my history with Lee. She said I “ had no business spending money on some other bitch”. Keep in mind, we do not share bank account or finances, we do not live together, and pay no bills together. My GF sometimes struggles with money, and I always try to help her out when I can, to be honest I do enjoy spending money on my GF. But I said if you want to break up because of this we should probably because this was inconsequential, and I would hate to face a real hurdle with you if this is how you act.

"AITA for not taking my sister with me on my third date?","NTA. If you like the guy, don't take her. Usually meeting a sibling/family manifests some sort of progress/milestone in relationship, you are way too early for that. Just think how you would feel if he would bring his sibling on a date. It would be so weird, to say the least.",1,0,431,431,"Some background, I (24F) have been talking to a guy (22M) for about 2 months now, we have finally started to date and are planning to go out for our 3rd date next week. I really like this guy and it's my first proper relationship as I have always been a bit too busy with work for a relationship but I really wanna put in the effort and enjoy myself and overcome my anxieties. Yesterday I told my sister(25F) that I plan on going with this guy to a restaurant that she has been wanting to try out and basically said ""Oh hey I can try it out with my date and then you and I can go together if it's good"" and that's when she got upset with me. She looked visibly hurt and I feel terrible. She asked if I even thought about bringing her too on this date so she can also get to know the guy and I told her I did but thought for a third date it might be too early for them to get to know each other. I also want to get to know this guy with it just being us alone. She hasn't really talked to me since that and is acting very cold toward me. I tried to ask her if she wants to be the one I take first and she blew up on me saying that I m in the wrong for not wanting it to be the three of us on this date cause she just wants to get to know him as well...so it seems like it's not about the restaurant and more of I didn't want to go with her and this has me confused.

I feel very conflicted because on one hand I want to be alone with my date and on the other hand I don't want my sister to be upset with me, she has also been having a difficult time at work so it's been difficult because I can't even really be excited around her about this new relationship, I noticed in the beginning when I do this I was getting one word answers or short answers from her so I dialed it down. I know it's not her fault that she is stressed and I obviously wouldn't want her to pretend to be in a great mood just cause I m in a new relationship, so I understand.

I have considered just folding and asking her if she will go with me but I also really don't want to so maybe I really am just being an asshole.

Am  I the asshole here for not wanting her to go with me?

&#x200B;

EDIT - I feel a lot less conflicted about the situation now. I 100% will not be taking her on this date or any for that matter and I also probably need to set some boundaries in my relationship with my sister because I even considered taking her and I can see it is not a normal thing now. Thank you to everyone who took the time to respond, I feel a lot better now .

Some more background:

1. She is single, has been since she finished University, so perhaps it's a factor
2. She met the guy briefly when he picked me up for the first date
3. When she was dating I never asked to join or be invited to a date so her reaction has caught me by surprise",431,"bizianka","Ok_Que",0

The only problem is that it costs $5,000, which is way more than she had budgeted for. She's asked me if I would be willing to contribute $1,000 towards the dress, as an early wedding gift, since I'm her maid of honor and we've been friends for over a decade.

While I'm happy to support my friend on her wedding day, I just can't justify spending that much money on a dress that she'll only wear once. I've already spent a lot of money on the bachelorette party, bridal shower, and other wedding-related expenses, and I'm not sure I can afford to add another $1,000 to the tab.

My friend is a little bit of a bridezilla, and she's been very focused on having the ""perfect"" wedding. I'm worried that if I don't contribute to the dress, she'll be upset with me and it could put a strain on our friendship.

I will disclose that I have Aspergers and I often miss social cues or unwritten rules.

My brother needs a place to live. He wants to live with me. It's not that he will end up on the streets without it. But he can't afford to buy a house, he will have to live in an apartment. He can't afford to live on his own. He will have to live with one or multiple roommates. He doesn't want to live in an apartment, he wants to live in a house. I am a homeowner so he wants to live here. He doesn't want to live with roommates. I don't count as a roommate because I'm his brother and we shared a bedroom until the year 2002. I was 24 and he was 22. In 2002 he graduated from college and I graduated with my Master's degree and both of us moved out of our parent's house at that time. So since we shared a room before and we are brothers I don't count a roommate.

The thing is I don't want him to live with me. If he was starving and on the streets I would probably change my mind. But he wants to live with me only because he doesn't want to live in an apartment or with roommates. If he lived with me he couldn't pay me nearly enough to cover 50% of my mortgage or other bills either.

My parents retired and sold their house and moved into a retirement and assisted living community on January 2. It forbidden for anyone who is not a resident to live there. My sister joined the military in the year 2002 when she finished high school. She lives on a base because she has never been married or had any children. She said she doesn't want my brother living with her even if he was allowed (he is not). My grandma, grandpa and nana are all in full nursing homes so he can't live with them (my papa died many years ago). All of his friends are married and have kids. I am the only relative of his who has a house and lives alone so he wants to live with me. He would need at least two years to be able to afford to live on his own and more for a down payment for a house.

I am not trying to be obtuse. I'm asking because my Aspergers makes it hard for me to read unwritten social rules. 

(To explain why he needs a new place to live: He got the house in his divorce. His ex-wife, my ex-sister-in-law was also paying him alimony of $6000.00 per month. They do not have children. But when the alimony expired he could not afford the house because he wasn't working and it has been foreclosed by the bank. My brother has until April 30 to leave his house. My dad got a friend of his to give my brother a job. He started there two weeks ago. He works at the headquarters for an insurance company now. So he has a job but like I said he can't afford to live in a house or without roommates.

"AITA for telling my sister if she was my stepmom I wouldn't name my kid after her either?","NTA",1,0,4650,4650,"My sister has been married to her husband Nigel for 21 years and they have been together for about 23 years. Nigel was a widower of three years when he met my sister. His kids at the time of them meeting were 6f and 8m. Nigel's late wife's family was around a lot. My sister hated it. From the very early days it was clear she was toxically jealous of Nigel's late wife and the kids mom. She talked about how strange it was the kids, who didn't remember her, had her photo in their bedrooms, how her stepdaughter had a locket with a photo of her mom, dad and brother in it. I remember back then asking how it was strange. Her mom was loved and Nigel and his late wife's family likely didn't want the kids to not know they were loved by their mom. She said that was her job now. I told her it wasn't healthy to feel that jealous and put out over a mom being remembered. Think of how she would feel if our mom died.

Honestly, I had a lot of respect for Nigel for the first two or three years because his kids seemed to be his priority and he seemed to still love and care about his late wife and not want to erase her but was also ready to be married to someone else. I had seen a lot of far more awful scenarios. But then he started letting my sister push herself onto the kids and try to force out their maternal relatives. It was very clear my sister blamed the maternal relatives for neither of her stepkids coming to think of her as their mom. She didn't want to hear any other reason it could be.

Now both of her stepkids are adults and her stepson became a father for the first time in January. His daughter is named after both her grandmother's. But his mom's name is her first name. My sister was so unhappy about that. She told him it was disrespectful to her and all that crap. He told her to go fuck herself and told her she still hadn't figured out that she wasn't his mom, she wasn't his parent, she wasn't even his real family, because he would happily dump her out of his life for good and would never feel bad about that.

My sister bitched for weeks about it and then I told her if I was her stepkid, I'd do the same. That she had no respect for his mom and had no respect for his maternal family. She freaked out and told me that was a shitty thing to say and I should be on HER side, because she's my SISTER.

YTA",14,0,510,510,"Recently, we had a birthday party for my (32f) son (7m) He invited some of his classmates and our neighbour's kids who he's close with. One of them was a 12-year-old boy who brought a doll-type thing which glowed and made noises if you pressed a button. We opened the present later after the party, and even though my son was happy to receive it, I noticed that the toy had a cracked shoulder.

The next day, when the boy came to play with my son and the other kids, I asked him who brought the gift, and he said he did it. I showed him the broken part and lightly scolded him. I simply told him that if he was going to spend money buying something, he should've checked the thing. I gave it back to him and told him to ask the store to replace it since it's broken. I thought it was a good life lesson and that he'd remember this. It would help him when he buys something later on. It would teach him not to waste his money.

However, later that evening his mom called me and told me that I was very rude to her son. She said and I quote ""if someone gives you a gift, you just appreciate it and don't say anything even if it's not that good, especially when it's a kid"" Turns out, he bought it with his own pocket money, and he put a lot of thought into it.

My little brother is an asshole.  I don't blame my mom for that.",-13,0,1150,1150," Last summer my brother's wife left him. He initially tried to hide the reason why but as it turns out he had been abusing her and she finally left him over his treatment of her oldest son. They have 4 children together (8M/5F/4F/0M) and she has an older son (16M). After finding out the reason for separation my sister and I no longer have a relationship with our brother. 

My dad & brother couldn't care less to have found out that their son/brother was abusing his partner and have been painting his ex the one to blame. My mom is having a hard time. My brother has always been her favorite child and although she has become a lot colder with him she still has a relationship with him. 

When SIL left my brother, it was the start of the kids summer break and she took them to stay with her dad in a different state. A month later she gave birth to her youngest child. When my mom found out the baby had been born, she was upset that SIL hadn't contacted her as she had been present for her other kids birth. When she tried to contact SIL she wouldn't answer her calls/messages. 

In august, SIL moved back to our city so the kids could return to the same schools. Her and my brother have also sorted out custody/child support and my brother is only allowed a few hours of supervised visitation a week. Since then, my mom has been smothering SIL. It comes from a good place; she feels guilty about what her son did and wants to support SIL. She has been going to all the kids’ events/sports games, taking them out regularly, spoiling them with gifts (I think she spent close to $1000 on the 16 yr olds birthday), and has been inviting herself over to SILs house a lot. 

I know SIL is grateful for the help I think she finds my mom's presence a bit much. She recently told my mom (while I was present) that she didn't want to see her until spring break and that afterwards they would sit down and create some boundaries in their relationship and her relationship with the kids. My mom was very upset and called my SIL ungrateful for everything she had done for her and that she would struggle as a single mom without her help. They argued for a while before my mom and I left. In the car my mom tried to get me on her side, but I told her I agreed with SIL and that she had been smothering her and the kids too much and they needed space. 

A few days ago, my mom and I got into an argument about it again. My mom tried to defend herself by saying something along the lines of ""it's not my fault \[brother\] abused her"" to which I responded that she did hold some blame as she was the one who raised him and arguably helped program his sense of arrogance by favoring him. My mom is now angry at me that I would take SIL's side and overreacting about what I said. Even my sister thinks I'm in the wrong. AITA?",1150,"cuervoguy2002","yesterdayaccurate535",0

Not helping at all. I've told him that. But after being followed when I was on the phone and having his mother try talking over the conversation I was having, it was the final straw. I packed my stuff and went to a hotel by myself. The $250 of my money to get home was now spent because I needed to get away before I lost it. My fiance knew I was beyond touched out and I warned him this was going to happen but apparently he didn't believe me. So now he's shocked that I would do this and make everything awkward for him and spend my portion of the trip money. AITA?

ETA: I mentioned to my in laws directly a few times that I needed space to decompress. Even when stating I needed to go on a walk to clear my head, they took it as an invitation to come along, despite me stating I needed space. Or like when I went to the bedroom, I announced it to the entire room that I needed a minute, and they proceeded to continuously yell up to me to make sure I was good. So they were fully aware that I was getting touched out but it seems like in their head that meant that they needed to helicopter and make sure I was okay by tagging along and watching me. We had plenty of money to get home. We set aside a specific set of money for the gas back. Me spending my set aside money for the gas back did not in any way leave us stranded here.",2917,"ramsrude","Fabulous_Meet_2065",0

My mother, a 55-year-old female, is a saleswoman and still has to pay all of her debts because of losing money while investing in stocks. We still live in a resettlement apartment owned by my grandparents because I have to take care of them and my mom doesn't have enough money to move out. As you can see, we have been broke since I was a kid so in my teenage year we couldn't afford to go to a dermatologist to treat my acne and acne scars. When I turned 18, I went to a doctor once and he told me that I must do laser treatment or it won't disappear. But I didn't have money to do it so I refused. I went back to doing skincare and hoped for the best.

At this age, I still suffer from it but people around me don't talk about it anymore, I guess they're used to seeing my face covered with a ton of red spots. But the one who is annoyed by my scars is my mom. She always tells me how ugly I am with all those scars and blames me for how uncareful and stupid I am for having acne in the first place. I'm used to it but today I just talked back to her. I told her I'm sorry that I'm not good enough and not pretty enough. I told her that if she finds me that ugly, the best thing I could do to not let her see me again is to leave this house for good. She was shocked and said that I was rude to her. She told me how polite she was when talking to me and that I was a spoiled brat.

I don't know what to do anymore. I will apologize to her because after all, she is my mother but the things she said really hurt my feelings.

I have known his brother’s girlfriend for 4 years. We’re not extremely close but we hang out whenever there’s a family get together.

Anyways, for her bridal party she’s asked me to be the Maid of Honour. She has four other bridesmaids composed of cousins and old school friends. I told her that I’m very grateful that she has asked me but unfortunately I don’t have the time to do all the things expected of a MOH. I just had my first baby in November and it’s a lot. She has expressed wanting a bridal shower, bachelorette party, etc.

I told her I can just be a regular bridesmaid. She seemed fine but afterwards, my husband told me that she was venting to my brother and telling him that I’m being cold to her. According to her, she thinks I’m lying by saying I’m too busy because I’m on maternity leave and that I have “all the time in the world” and all her other friends work full time. 

My husband agrees with me but his brother called me said I should try to “be accommodating to her”. I reconsidered and told her I would be her MOH if she covers half of the responsibilities, eg planning the bachelorette party. He said he would get back to me.

The next day, she calls me and asks me why I’m being so difficult. She says I’m the only one in the bridal party not working and that I should step up. I told her again that I’m on maternity leave taking care of a baby and it is actually even more demanding than full time work. She ended the call quite upset.

I am not here being so negative. I appreciate that I am working in a well-established company. I recently starting joining this one company with a small team of 7 since 1 Feb. My salary is very basic for a mere fresh graduate (< 2 years). I am still not satisfied with the salary offered, but I took it due to gaining new experience and acquiring new skills.

However, I recently got asked to treat my colleagues in the office with my first salary. For examply, I should bring them to a nice restaurant. I am not keen on treating anyone because I have other bills to pay and their salary are 2-7 times higher than mine. That's crazy shit. All of my colleagues (skilled foreigners) are males. I realize that they are so lazy. When I was not in the office for a week, they could not able to throw out the garbage.

I feel that asking how much I earn and asking to be treated are rude. I treat people when I am able to.

Do you think I am the asshole or just need to chill? I cannot chill because their salary are 2-7 times higher. Everything is paid by our company with their house and car (sponsored by the company). Why should I treat them when they have many beenfits while staying in my country (Brunei)?

Note that I maintain a neutral relationship with my collegues. I just do not have the desire to treat them when they are financially stable and their personalities are not that great (talking others behind their back, etc).

&#x200B;

Caden is very obsessed with seeming masculine, and he takes a lot of pride in his personal style. He has a decent following on YouTube  and TikTok, and his “brand” is basically about being a player and attracting girls.

Well, he was making a video yesterday with some fairly expensive jeans he copped from a local custom designer. They are light pink and he was having trouble finding a shirt to match. He came out to the kitchen complaining, and I told him to wear this tee I got for his birthday last month. I told him the pattern had some pink in it and would match well with pink jeans.

Caden immediately started yelling and kicking off. He insisted that they weren’t pink, and accused me of gaslighting him. He said they were red and I just had an agenda of masculating him. These jeans are literally rose pink, so I was definitely not gaslighting him.

He called our mom at work (this was during her lunch hour) and told her what I said. My mom took Caden’s side and accused me of raining on my brothers parade by making him feel bad about his new clothes. I replied that I don’t think guys wearing pink is bad, and Caden is just making drama over nothing.

Now Caden won’t wear the jeans, and because they aren’t returnable, my mom wants me to reimburse him the cost of the jeans. There’s no way I’m doing that.

Kai was upset and was talking about how much it sucked. I told him I got it. He said everyone in his family was telling him he should be happy because he wouldn't have to listen to his parents fight anymore and he should be happy they're divorcing. Kai said he wasn't. I told him neither was I. That I knew nobody with divorced parents who wanted them to be divorced or were happy about it. I told him most of my friends have divorced parents and all of them wish it hadn't happened. Heather and her sister overheard what I said to Kai and I got into so much trouble for saying it. They said it was unfair to make him think being unhappy with the divorce is okay and I shouldn't be saying that when I grew my family because of the divorce.

I do find this funny because Heather and her kids (her little demons as I call them in my head) were no great family addition. Most of the time I have to make sure none of my stuff has been broken or stolen and to never ever buy snacks for myself with my money because that stuff will be gone. I also get to hear about them getting suspended from school every time I'm at my dad's.

The functionality of the thing is great, and it's not locked like a handheld console is so you can install a different OS if you want.  If you're tech savvy you can make almost anything work on it.

It's great if you like handhelds.  The battery life isn't spectacular.  If I fire up Elden Ring it says I have 2-3 hours of battery life.  Some games you can turn down the settings, screen brightness, turn on airplane mode, limit the hardware, and I've seen it say I have another 6-8 hours left.

I think it mostly depends on you and your wants.  For me it's simply a gaming tablet or something with a controller built in.  I put SO MANY HOURS into my 3ds, this is just an upgrade without 3d.

I mostly got one so I could bring it places and plug it in, so battery life isn't super important unless I'm away from power.  If you're planning to get hours and hours of portable gaming, might not be the best.

Also if you're in a spot where you can just get a desktop, that's probably the better choice, but you can get a USB hub or the steam dock and plug in a monitor, keyboard, mouse, extra controllers, whatever peripheral you want.

I love it personally as I can play outside, let a friend borrow it, remote play, etc.  I love the dual trackball feeling touch pads, and the 4 extra triggers.  Everything is so easily customizable.  I of course spent days when I first got it just seeing what I could get to work, as im the kind of gamer to put hours into modding skyrim only to finally get it to work and never play again.

Leave.",1,0,103,103,"I (F20) have been working for a family (4 kids) as their nanny/family assistant for a little over a year now.  Upon hiring, we agreed to specific duties and a solid schedule.  My mornings would basically be arriving at 630 AM, wake the kids and feed them breakfast, get them ready, then drop them at school.  While the kids are at school, I would do laundry, dishes, daily light cleaning, etc.  After school is done I pick the kids up, spend the afternoon with them/take them to activities/appointments, and then prepare dinner for the whole family/clean up after, and hopefully leave by 630 PM.  While I have always felt like I was a tad bit underpaid for my work, it’s gotten a little out of hand lately.  Over the year, more and more has been sprinkled onto my plate without a pay increase.  I do meal planning now, grocery shopping for the whole week, put the parents laundry away for them, complete house (3 floors 😫) cleaning (wiping bathrooms and kitchen, vaccum, dust, mop, you get the point.), deep cleaning like fridges/stains, snow removal, and more.  Not to mention that over the weekends, they don’t touch the dishes/laundry/house so on Monday I’m doing a whole weekend of dishes, laundry and cleaning.  Also added onto this, the oldest daughter is now struggling a lot more with mental health issues.  I feel so terrible for her and will never understand how she feels completely, but she treats me terribly.  She lies to me about doing her 3 simple tasks everyday after school, talks bad about me to the other 3 kids (who love me thank god), screams at me if I tell her/ask her to do literally anything she doesn’t agree with.  I just don’t think she has an easy time with authority and her mom has kind of expressed that too.  The parents kind of bounce around that issue until it gets really bad and then they come up with a new temporary solution to try and get her to do her chores/listen to me.  I should also say my car gets TRASHED and it makes me really sad because it’s my first newer car that I bought all by myself.  Regardless, this job has just become a lot more demanding… I think?  Am I crazy? I don’t want to say I feel used but I do just feel mad when I think about it.  I should mention that we discussed a raise when adding grocery shopping and meal planning onto my plate, but it’s been 2 months if me doing it and nothing has happened.  Also the mom literally tells me i’m the backbone of their family and the only the reason she can pursue her career in the way she is.  I feel so shitty about even considering leaving.

"AITA for kicking my friend out after she said I was treating my dog like a ""servant""?","NTA. The point of your video seemed to be to show how smart Nala was, not to show she was a servant. If she couldn't figure that on her own, she probably wasn't going to figure out why you kicked her out.",1,0,6330,6330,"I F27 recently moved into my new house. I have a golden retriever named Nala and she is the sweetest. 

I'm Deaf, too. That bit is important. When I moved in, I had a bit of trouble having flashing light doorbells put in and there was a while I had to go without. My friends and family know to give me a call when they drop by instead of ringing the doorbell but unfortunately I have missed many a package this way. 

For some reason, Nala caught onto this. At one point she began letting me know when someone was at the door. She'd do this in multiple ways. If I was in the living room where I can see the front door,  she'd go and paw at the door, or if I was upstairs she'd come and gently headbutt me  to let me know someone's there. It took me a while to catch on to what she was trying to do, though. 

And now, even though I  have my doorbell installed she still does it. I did not teach her how to do any of this. She just decided to help me out lol.  

I brought a friend over for the first time recently. This is the first time she's met Nala as well. The first thing she comments on is how I named her Nala, because  apparently everyone and their grandma names their golden Nala. Lion King was my favorite movie growing up, sue me. 

Then I showed her a video of Nala pawing at the door because it got a bit awkward after that comment. It's usually a great ice breaker. She laughed and thought it was cute. I showed her another one. She asked me why Nala was doing that and I explained. 

She doesn't say anything for a minute and then goes ""So, she's basically your servant? Is she just here to get the door?"" 

I was thoroughly done with her judgmental ass by that point and I just asked her to leave. She left, but she did message me afterwards saying I was rude as fuck kicking her out after she travelled all the way to see me, and that how else was she supposed to think of my dog with videos like that?",6330,"TimelySecretary1191","day6fan",0

"AITA for refusing to speak to help my sister after she berated my boyfriend?","NTA this is a situation in which OP basically has no control over. It’s a house that’s over packed and OP’s privacy isn’t respected. I don’t know the layout of the house but the first thing that should have been done if a kitchen is being converted to a bedroom is to move ANYTHING that would be needed in constant use out of the area to provide some level of privacy. 

Depending on the style of wash dryer (front loading or top loading) it’s usually possible to stack and relocate them. A professional would be needed to relocate the water hook up and draining the washer but the exhaust vent for the dryer can be extended easily.

That would solve the issue of people constantly trying to go into OP’s private space provided there’s room to relocate the washer and dryer even if it would be just outside of the room. 

The long and short you’re NTA for wanting your privacy respected especially when it’s seems like you’re the only person in the house that has the issue. Regardless of it being something that everyone needs to use you were placed there with out anyone considering your privacy. The fact that some people are suggesting you’re at fault for wanting people to wait to do laundry when you’re not sleeping and to respect your privacy by giving you aheads up is normal and reasonable. As is not wanting to help someone out who wronged you, recovering from surgery doesn’t excuse being hurtful hateful and racist for no reason especially if it’s “being disrespected in your house”. Last I checked it’s your moms house and your sister is staying there it’s not her home, and aside from that the disrespectful one there would have been her for not being reasonable and respecting your request of privacy when you’re sleeping and being decent and respecting someone’s request to step out of the room so they can get dressed.",1,0,74,74,"   I (18m) live with my mom (45F), my two sisters (15f and 27f), older sisters three children (>1m, 3f, 6f), and her fiancé (28m). Our house is small and because of issues with my dad, I live in what used to be our house's second kitchen. My bedroom also has a washer and dryer, so people often need to come in to do laundry. My older sister often comes in without asking while I’m at work or sleeping, which I have asked her to stop. 

   Now, today, my partner (19m) was staying the night, as he usually does on Tuesday nights. Earlier today, older sister came to do laundry without knocking or making her presence known. My partner typically sleeps in his boxers and doesn’t feel comfortable around anyone aside from me while wearing only them. I was asleep, but when older sister came in, partner asked her to leave so he could put clothes on. She said “you have a blanket on, it’s not a big deal”. He woke me up, and I asked older sister to leave as politely as I could. Older sister then began to shout at my partner for being disrespectful in her house and demanded he leave. She called him many incredibly hurtful and at times, downright racist things (my partner is a dark-skinned Italian). He was upset and began to cry once she eventually left. 

   Once he left, I addressed how upset I was with my sister and told her that she hurt him. She said that he deserved it and shouldn’t have spoken out of turn with her. I knew if I tried to go any further, I’d be screamed at until she cried and made it my fault. Now, I refuse to speak to her or help with any of her daily tasks. She’s recovering from a C-section and has a hard time lifting heavy objects. I feel bad for not helping her, even though she upset my partner and won’t apologize. AITA?

Edit: Spelling. English isn't my first language </3

"AITA for not sharing my “toys” with my best friend’s daughter?","NTA.  It won't last long. She'll be calling when she needs a free babysitter.  Don't cave to her, or she will be raising an entitled bratt.",1,0,6923,6923,"So my (31F) best friend “Riley” (31F) recently just got a part-time job after several years of staying home with her daughter “Ella” (6F). She and her husband “Joe” (34M) haven’t been able to get the childcare situation totally sorted out and needed a babysitter last Saturday, so I agreed to watch Ella for the day while Riley was at work. 

I've been sort of the ""cool aunt"" ever since Ella was born. I typically will bring small gifts or activities whenever I know that I will be seeing her, which isn't all that often. Ella is a smart and engaged kid and I like to give her things that will interest her and keep her occupied.

One important piece of information here is that I'm a very crafty person. I have a small online store and also work with local businesses for selling and distributing small batches of my product - hand painted wooden figurines. I thought it might be fun to introduce Ella into my hobby/business, so I ended up bringing 10 unpainted figurines to choose from, a few tubes of acrylic paint, and some paint brushes. 

We immediately got to work and Ella was *so* into it. She had an absolute blast painting her turtle figurine. But when it came time for me to leave, I started packing up all of my supplies and Ella became visibly upset. Riley insisted that I leave the supplies behind so that Ella could keep and play with them. I disagreed, and basically said that I have no obligation to give away any of my belongings. 

I personally feel like I was more than generous by babysitting Ella on my day off (I do have a regular 9-5 job as well) and providing a fun activity for her. Riley pointed out that I have a pretty large stock of items at home, which is true, but still - letting Ella keep the supplies and figurines would've been a loss in profit for my business. Ella cried when I didn't let her keep any of the stuff and Riley argued that I should have never brought “toys” over if I wasn't willing to let Ella keep them. 

Now Riley hasn't been responding to any of my messages or calls and I can only assume she's still angry over this whole thing. I thought I was doing something nice by babysitting and providing a fun activity.

I was really young when we first started dating and the nagging of my MIL, wanting us to have kids early, always bothered me. I took my complaints to my fiancé but he dismissed me saying that i should ""understand his mother's ways"". I didn't get her hopes up about me having kids, because i always said that i wanted to mature enough to be able to raise a kid.

As i said, i just dismissed her nagging, until last week.

My fiancé came home from work (that btw he works with his mother), saying: ""I was with mom all that in the office,and after she told me some things i came to the conclusion that you should stop taking your birth control pills"". Unbelievable. Didn't even want to argue about something this ridiculous.

Time passed and we didn't touch this issue anymore.

The weekend came, and we went to visit my MIL's house, she took me to her room saying she needed to have a word with me and my fiancé.

She sat down on the bed and said: ""I had a discussion with Luiz (my fiancé's name), and i told him about my concern with you guys not having children at the appropriate age. Who knows if you're going to be able to have children with this disease of yours? As for now, he will no longer allow you to buy the birth control pills per my request""

(He never buyed them for me, i work 9 hours a day and everything i buy for myself comes from my money)

About ""my disease"": It's a disease that all the women in my father's side had: Uterus Cancer. My great-great-grandmother passed due to it, my great-grandmother too and my grandma had it after giving birth to my father, but the doctors took the uterus out before the cancer could spread further. My grandma was always cautious with me. Never had any issues, and i go to the gynecologist 2 times a year to do exams.

 I got enraged, and looked at my fiancé who was sitting beside her, and he just averted his eyes.

""you will regret leaving the thoughts of having kids after your graduation, because god time is now and i got a revelation from the pastor that one of my family members is going to try to have kids and it's not gonna be able to. I'm sure that person is you, and i'm worried for my son. I can't leave this marriage be if your thoughts don't align.""

When she said that last line, i exploded, saying ""Are you so desperate for me to sit on your son's cock and have a baby so what? It's not your business if we're having kids or not or if we're having sex or not, this must be a joke"".

The argument escalated but i don't remember much because i got so enraged that i started trembling and had to go home to calm myself down alone, as i left my fiancé there.

When he came home, he was pissed off saying that i disrespected his mother and that if i didn't apologise he would consider breaking off the engagement. Honestly am not making any effort to set things straight as i'm very offended by everything she said.

"AITA for not sharing my “toys” with my best friend’s daughter?","NTA You did something kind and generous and your friend tried to take advantage. Kids being kids, I can see Ella being tearful, but that's when your friend should have redirected Ella to talking about her turtle or explained that you were taking your supplies back so other kids could also enjoy painting figurines.  


Your friend will come around when she needs ""fun aunt"" to baby sit again. Right now she's trying to use the silent treatment to manipulate you. Don't go for it. And when she does contact you again, it's time to set down some boundaries.  


But as a crafty person myself, I gotta say I would love to see your figurines!",1,0,6923,6923,"So my (31F) best friend “Riley” (31F) recently just got a part-time job after several years of staying home with her daughter “Ella” (6F). She and her husband “Joe” (34M) haven’t been able to get the childcare situation totally sorted out and needed a babysitter last Saturday, so I agreed to watch Ella for the day while Riley was at work. 

I've been sort of the ""cool aunt"" ever since Ella was born. I typically will bring small gifts or activities whenever I know that I will be seeing her, which isn't all that often. Ella is a smart and engaged kid and I like to give her things that will interest her and keep her occupied.

One important piece of information here is that I'm a very crafty person. I have a small online store and also work with local businesses for selling and distributing small batches of my product - hand painted wooden figurines. I thought it might be fun to introduce Ella into my hobby/business, so I ended up bringing 10 unpainted figurines to choose from, a few tubes of acrylic paint, and some paint brushes. 

We immediately got to work and Ella was *so* into it. She had an absolute blast painting her turtle figurine. But when it came time for me to leave, I started packing up all of my supplies and Ella became visibly upset. Riley insisted that I leave the supplies behind so that Ella could keep and play with them. I disagreed, and basically said that I have no obligation to give away any of my belongings. 

I personally feel like I was more than generous by babysitting Ella on my day off (I do have a regular 9-5 job as well) and providing a fun activity for her. Riley pointed out that I have a pretty large stock of items at home, which is true, but still - letting Ella keep the supplies and figurines would've been a loss in profit for my business. Ella cried when I didn't let her keep any of the stuff and Riley argued that I should have never brought “toys” over if I wasn't willing to let Ella keep them. 

Now Riley hasn't been responding to any of my messages or calls and I can only assume she's still angry over this whole thing. I thought I was doing something nice by babysitting and providing a fun activity. 

AITA for not letting Ella keep my crafting supplies?

First, unless you live in some weird dictatorship, you can easily file an amended return on your mother's taxes. Second, that money is your husband's too, since you file joint returns. Third, I agree with him that you are just as selfish and thoughtless as his first wife.",22,0,50,50,"
My husband and I have been married for almost 2 years. His ex-wife was a princess who never worked or contributed to the family but spent lavishly on herself. We both work but I make more money than he does and he is still paying the huge legall fees from his divorce but we have been splitting all our joint living expenses 50/50. Last year we got a $5000 refund from our joint tax return. We use my accountant so all the filings and returns go through me. For the same tax year I made a mistake on my elderly mothers tax return that cost  her almost $5000. I felt bad so I gave her our joint refund but didn't tell my husband we had gotten a refund nor that I was keeping it for my mom. He recently had a small financial windfall from an airline that thought they lost his luggage but really didn't. He used the money to pay me back money he owed me but i feel as though half that money should be mine anyway. When we argued about that he asked about our tax refund and i reluctantly him the truth. Now he is angry and says I'm like his ex-wife who always thought what was theirs was hers and what was his was theirs and that he could have used his half of the refund to pay some of his legal expenses. My mom is 93 and has savings plus an income from a job as well as social security but has high rent expenses.  So I think I was in the right. Also even though it was his luggage and he did all the legwork to get a refund from the airline I feel it was like winning the lottery so we should have shared the money. Is he right to feel angry or AITA for thinking that I had the right to use our refund to help my mother and that his windfall should be shared?",50,"FortuneTellingBoobs","plaicecover",0

I was just in a situation where I witnessed something and informed the person who's car was affected. The offender ended up punching me after a verbal altercation. I still don't regret getting involved because I'd want someone to help me if I was in a situation like that.",1,0,2255,2255,"There are two lat pull down set-ups at our gym and it is a VERY busy gym. 

I (33F) was working out on a machine behind the lat pull downs and saw this lady (prob in her early 40s, very fit) sitting on one of the machines, chatting away, not doing a single rep. The other lat pull down was occupied by two guys going pretty hard. 

A little background: This lady is a repeat offender-she loves to sit on a machine-not use it- and chat with people…once the conversation is done she’ll eventually start her workout (the number of times I’ve waited for her on the leg abductor and leg press while she chatted away not using the machine…I digress…back to the story).

I saw a timid girl (probably late teens early 20s) shyly/very politely ask the lady if she could work in-the lady said no, that she hadn’t used it yet. The girl walked away, looking embarrassed.

I got hot. 

I called out to the lady and said with very clear irritation “excuse me, ma’am, hey. It’s  very busy right now. I’ve watched you sit on this machine for at least the last 5 minutes chatting to your buddy without doing a single rep. If you’re not going to use it, it’s f*****d up to not let someone else in.” 

The lady told me I was rude but got up and let the other girl (who mouthed me a “thank you”) in. 

The lady also reported me to management for “being rude” (didn’t affect my membership, just a quick word from an employee) and now this lady proceeds to glare at me anytime she sees me in the gym. 

When I told my friend they said that the lady was obviously messed up, but it was not my place to say anything to her. Also that my condescending tone would have riled anyone up.

Lily is a bully. I have met her a handful of times and she is always making fun of Eni, who is a little fat, Lily's always telling that bad pig jokes and she even gave Eni a nickname, Pigni.
I have complained to Tom and Tom's mom that Lily's jokes weren't funny and she should stop, but they always said she was just joking. I told Eni that she should return the jokes to Lily, but she can never think of anything to say.
Last year I was invited to Tom's family's Christmas party, everything was fine until Lily said something like ""Oh God Eni, you've already eaten so much, at this pace you'll stop being Pigni to become Whalni"" and she laugh with the children at the party. I was furious and Eni and Tom gave a fake laugh and said that Eni was 4 months pregnant. When we were all congratulating them, Lily said ""wow, at least now you can excuse yourself when people see you eating like a pig."" I got furious again but Eni asked me to just let it go but I know how much that jokes hurt her. So I went back to having a talk with Tom and his mother about why Lily's teasing had to stop.
 Well, this weekend was Eni's babyshower, we were having a good time until Lily told another joke about how ""fat"" Eni had gotten, I had enough so I laughed so loud to attract attention and said ""Oh Lily, you're so funny, especially when you finish your jokes with that ugly pig laugh, sometimes I think people laugh more at your laugh than at your joke."" Lily got super serious and she told me it wasn't funny, to which I said ""come on, it's a joke"" and imitated her laugh, the kids at the party laughed too and Lily ran away while she cried. Tom's mother scolded me for the joke and I asked her why Lily's jokes were funny but mine weren't, if they both had a pig joke in it, and her mother couldn't answer me. I told her that every time I heard Lily tell a joke about Eni, I would return the joke. Eni told me that I shouldn't have done that, but I could see her hold back her laughter along with the other guests, but I'm tired of Eni being walked over. They have told me that since I am older than Lily I should behave better.

He recently told me that *actually*, they used to date exclusively a few years ago, for a couple of months, but weren’t “boyfriend and girlfriend” 🙄 and she is ‘Sarah from work’ as they met through work…but calling her that is pretty misleading 

He said he didn’t think it’s relevant information as they weren’t serious and it was ages ago. When I asked him about the timing he did say that she’d recently gotten into a relationship, so I think he’s conveniently decided to tell me the whole story now so it looks better for him as she’s no longer single.

He’s apologised and has suggested I meet Sarah so I can ‘see how nice she is and that they’re very platonic’ but I’ve told him that right now I have zero interest in meeting her.

I know she misses having a glass every once in a while. She’s been especially strong when I had my buddies over to watch sports and we had a few beers. Also she loves her coffee and I couldn’t tell you how she went to work for 8 months without it. So I felt bad and splurged.

While I was waiting to exit the airplane, the person sitting in the seat next to where I was standing asked me “have the rules changed “and I pretended not to hear him because I had headphones on and I didn’t say anything to him. Then he got up and said, “why don’t you go back to the back and wait like everyone else.” I didn’t respond again but this time there was a lady behind me who said she needed to catch her connecting flight that was already boarding. The guy then said “well the rules havent changed but if you want to be a jerk go ahead.” 

The lady who had the connecting flight definitely had a valid reason to “cut” in line, but when was this ever a rule lol? I don’t think I did anything wrong because everyone who I “skipped” could have gotten up and waited in the aisle, so AITA here?

SIL is Sophie, she’s 26F and married to my husband’s brother. I’m 29F.

Sophie has been married to my BIL since late 2021. Whenever we have had holidays she has spent it with her family, and my husband and I only go back to his hometown during the holidays - so I don’t know her well.

Anyway we have a holiday coming up in just over a month. For the first time Sophie’s parents will be away so she will be celebrating with us.

That’s all background. As is the fact that my MIL is a trained patissier. I promise it’s relevant.

I happened to be in town this week and MIL started putting together her list of ingredients for the stuff she will make. She was consulting me, and my husband’s sister Zara, about what to make and also delegated a couple of things to each of us.

Sophie came into the living room and said “oh I can definitely make better brownies, tartlets and whatever else than [my name]!”

Now my MIL takes desserts very seriously. I said okay you can make that stuff but MIL said no we need to have the nicest sweets. There was a back and forth and Sophie suggested what I can only describe as a bake off.

So we made brownies, tiramisu, lemon meringue and the family judged between us and everyone voted in my favour. 

Sophie got mad at me and said I’d hidden the fact that I know how to bake from her to which Zara said neither of us really bake when MIL is around because she’s amazing but that we both *can* if we need to.

Now Sophie is mad at me for both hiding my ability from her and for purposefully embarrassing her in front of our in laws. I think she’s stupid - she wanted the silly bake off right up until she lost, it’s not my fault she has an ego

(Edit: by request my brownie recipe can be found here 😅

I think our dad did a pretty shitty job at raising us, he wasn't there much, made us move a lot and had a dangerous job he kinda trained us into. My brother worshipped the man and always defended him which pissed me off, cause like the man always traited him like a good little soldier so he should be mad, right? Despite that, my brother was the one who was always here to protect me and raise me and even though he made mistakes I'm grateful for him and I love him. 

My dad wanted us both to follow his footsteps, saying the job was important and that he wanted us to stay in the family business. My brother agreed and never really invested himself in school and he eventually dropped out of high school. I had no intention of staying in this business forever, and while my family knew that, I don't think they ever took that seriously. A few months ago, I applied to college and eventually got a full ride. I didn't tell my brother about it because i knew he would have told my dad, and my dad would have been pissed. 

But at some point I had to leave for college and I thought it wouldn't be fair to just dip without explanation. I told my dad first, because while he would have the worst reaction, I cared about my brother's more than his. As planned, he got super mad. Told me I was damn ungrateful and everything. Not gonna go further into that, but my brother walked in on us and asked what was going on. My dad explained and then said that if i left, I would never be allowed to come back, that he would completely cut me out. I lowkey expected that. What I didn't expect was my brother to be completely silent about that, instead just telling me to stay and to ""not be stupid"". The job our dad does is important and saves a lot of people but I explained to him that I couldn't stay in this life and needed to find my own path. I just poured everything out and told him to come with me (we are pretty codependent since we grew up in each other's pocket and I knew getting away from him would hurt both of us). I could see he was torn but eventually he stayed loyal to our dad and that's when I picked up my backpack and went away. 

I knew at this point that my brother would never defend me against our dad, and that he would never support my decision to leave the family business. I love my brother and I feel bad for abandoning him. I know my dad isn't always kind to him and that the life we lived is pretty rough, so I'm worried about him.

So today I had an almost 3 hour meeting before dinner and let everyone know this morning. They said that’s fine we want to have dinner at a restaurant and there was no set time, it was just supposed to be in the evening. 

After I finished my meeting I went downstairs to see everyone sitting grumpily in the living room and saying they were waiting on me to finish my meeting and get ready. I told them it will take me at least half an hour. Their faces looked even more grumpy so I told them to leave without me and I’ll be fine, I don’t like the pressure of a whole group sitting there relying and waiting on me (and I have a bit of anxiety in situations like this). 

Am I an asshole for telling them to all just go? Or should I have rushed and got ready?

During this vacation situations like this have been happening a lot with certain activities and I’m just over it. Just go! I don’t need to do everything, I’m fine just being by myself sometimes and doing my own thing and not being forced to do things I’m not up for. 

Give me some perspective please 🙏🏾

***Update***

After their dinner my bf came back and told me privately that everyone was complaining at the dinner about waiting for me. Then he said he wishes I got ready before my meeting so I could have been there. 

Then my sister joined the convo and gave me a long speech that I should be more considerate of everyone’s time since they were considerate of my meeting … I told her I am absolutely considerate of everyone’s time - if there was a time to consider! I reminded her that there was no set time made and the only thing that was set was my meeting. 

She then said I should have been more proactive and got ready before my meeting so I could be ready right after and in the future maybe I should just get ready at the start of the day so I can be ready for whatever activities come along. 

I said no. I would prefer just knowing a time and being ready for whatever is planned and if I’m unable to make it then they will know in advance.

All our kids get along well, and we have a good relationship with each other’s children.

My parents are very doting grandparents to my 3 bio kids but have always been standoffish with my stepsons. There has been lots of little things over the years that have shown how little they care for them. They have never once bought them a birthday present (my wife's parents get my daughter's gifts) and at Christmas they are always given the most pathetic/cheap gift. It's not always bad as there has been times when, my dad in particular, has been good at engaging with them. In November he came with me and the boys to watch a football game and go out for lunch and everybody had a great time.

Last week my mom stayed with us as it was my daughter's 10th birthday. She stayed in the 17 year olds room and he slept on an air mattress in his brother's room. Not only did she never think to thank him, but she also tried banning him from going in the room at all when he occasionally needed to. One morning he knocked on the door to ask if he could go in to grab his sneakers and she said no and wouldn't even pass them to him. I had to intervene and get them myself. Despite this he was nothing but polite to her face. If I listed every passive aggressive thing she said/did to the boys during her stay it would make this post to long.

On Friday, the 13 yo and toddler were playing outside with a basketball. At one point 13 yo threw the ball a little too hard at his brother and knocked him over. My mom had been outside and saw what happened and started to berate the 13 yo and grabbing him hard by the arm. When his mom came outside to see why the baby was crying my mom continued to say foul things about my stepson and called him an awful brother and dangerous to her grandson. When stepson told his mom what he had accidentally done, my mom started raving about him doing it on purpose.

When I got home my stepson was sulking in his room. My wife had told me what had happened, so I went to see him, and we talked. He vented about how my mom had made him feel the whole week and asked me why she hated him and his brother. This made me angry and after talking with my wife, I decided to ask my mom to leave and told her she wouldn’t be welcome back until she corrected her attitude towards my stepsons. Of course, she didn’t take this well and after she argued with me for over an hour she left. Later I got a call from my dad who was livid, he wouldn’t let me explain myself, so I hang up.

I feel I did the right thing to protect my stepsons, but my siblings are also upset with me. They think I’m an ass for treating our mom badly and overreacting.

They didn't allow me to go to good colleges in other cities, citing financial reasons.

My sister and stepsister were both 13f and I was 14m. Dad went MIA when my sister and I were babies. Mom's had a few relationships since then but Jason is the first husband she's had. Jason's daughter is Rylee. Rylee's mom abandoned her when she was a baby too. Her mom died at some point but she only found in November. She'd never met her mom but it was hard on her.

Ever since Rylee found out her mom was dead, my mom has been trying to get her more friends in school. She's friends outside of school. But none actually in school. She wanted my sister to invite Rylee into her friendship group and my sister said no. Rylee and my sister do not like each other. From the first time we met her the two of them have had their issues. It bothers mom that my sister won't let it drop. It's started to get seriously tense between my mom and my sister. Mostly because my sister was hanging out with her friends one day and mom asked them if Rylee could join in (this was outside of school) and my sister's friends said no since Rylee isn't their friend and because my sister doesn't like her. Mom said my sister didn't mind. My sister said she did mind and she would rather stay alone in her room than hang out with Rylee. Mom told her she was turning into a real bully and Rylee was her sister and she should be trying to help her through her difficult time. My sister told mom they didn't like each other and didn't care about each other, so why would either of them want to help the other.

When my sister and I still hung out together after that incident, mom pulled me up and said I should be blasting my sister and including Rylee more. That I should be showing Rylee that loyalty I show my sister. I laughed and asked her why she thought I had loyalty for Rylee. Mom said of course I do, because we're family and she's my younger sister now and how could I not be loyal to her? That I have always been loyal to my sister. I told mom because my sister and I are siblings, close siblings, as well as friends, and I love her. That I don't have to be loyal to Rylee just because I'm loyal to my sister. I told her Rylee might be like a daughter to her now but she's not like a sister to me. She told me I was saying horrible things and I should be better than this. I told her to ask Rylee if she's an only child or has siblings. Mom said Rylee would of course answer that she has siblings. Newsflash: she doesn't but mom and Jason kinda too, like to ignore this and act like Rylee was so desperate to be siblings with us.

Mom told me I should be loyal to both sisters but especially to the one who needs me most right now (Rylee in her eyes). She told me I was not being a good big brother and I should be ashamed of myself for dismissing Rylee the way I do.

AITA?

ETA: Adding some stuff I cut because my post was originally too long.

Rylee and her friends have said my sister is fat. Not to my sister's face but still in the house. I think that's what made her dislike or target my sister. She probably saw her as an easy target and expected her to be all meek and quiet because of her body shape. She doesn't really come for me at all but I have told her to leave my sister alone since hearing her and her friends say that about my sister. I know she hasn't stopped talking about my sister like that either. But I only heard it twice after the first time but I know from how her friends act that they talk shit like that a lot.

While I was waiting to exit the airplane, the person sitting in the seat next to where I was standing asked me “have the rules changed “and I pretended not to hear him because I had headphones on and I didn’t say anything to him. Then he got up and said, “why don’t you go back to the back and wait like everyone else.” I didn’t respond again but this time there was a lady behind me who said she needed to catch her connecting flight that was already boarding.

So keep counting your blessings on those small city drives.",1,0,5772,5772,"My friend (""Samantha"") is a stay-at-home mom and has a four-year-old daughter (""Katie""). Since her daughter's birth, she always insisted that I go to her place if I ever wanted to hang out. Even though she lives about 45 minutes away from me, I always did it in the beginning because I did value our friendship, and Katie was her first, so I could understand how she'd be stressed with a newborn.

Recently, I started to put my foot down and wanted her to meet me halfway. I felt like her kid (she only has Katie) was old enough to handle being outside and I was tired of driving just to hang at her house. We always picked a place halfway, so I felt like it was doable. 

During the last three hangouts, she was over 30 minutes late, and each time she claimed that she got ""mom privileges"" for being late because she had to wrangle her kid into the car and do other ""mom things"" I wouldn't understand (according to her. I'm childless). 

She asked to hang out this past weekend, and I told her that if she was late again, I'd leave. Lo and behold, the day came and she was late. After 30 minutes, I got up and left, but went to hang in the coffeeshop across the street because I was curious just how late she'd be. She was over an hour late, and when she found out from the waitress that I left, she started to call and text me. 

She said that I was callous and selfish for making her drive 25 minutes away from home with a toddler only to leave, and that she only ever came out for my benefit. I told her that I hang out with multiple friends who bring their kids out with us, and they're never late, so it was pretty shitty to blame being late on Katie (who is a perfectly sweet girl. She's never been a problem during our outings). Samantha just kept pulling the ""you're not a mom so you wouldn't get it"" card. 

I heard later from a mutual friend that Samantha has been blasting me in their mommy group and said I was bullying her for putting her child first. I feel like her reaction wouldn't be so strong unless she was actually upset, so I'm starting to kind of feel like an AH. I mean, she's right that I don't ""get it"" as I don't have children, but I still feel annoyed that she's late and feel justified for leaving. My time is precious too!

I had to look after her a lot when we were younger because both my parents worked and have been butting heads since. She has been pretty rebelious since she was young and has always had a nasty attitude towards me, and so, I haven't always been the nicest to her.

She absolutely never listens to me and always says that I am not her second mom, and that she doesn't have three parents, which I agree with. Except that she uses it when its not necessary, like when I'm trying to tell her to do things so that my dad doesn't loose his temper when he gets home.

I fight with her the most though over cleaning the kitchen and her taking my stuff. She has started telling me what I will and will not do, which is unacceptable in my opinion. I am not allowed into her bedroom, even if she goes into mine, and I have to clean the kitchen, even if my mother has asked her to do so.

I have begged and pleaded that she stop's taking my stuff but she says that if I don't use it, than she can. Whether it's my makeup or clothing or even my art equipment, she takes it and fights if I try and take it back. She raises her voice so quickly, without me even doing anything, just to get me in trouble.

I found my expensive art equipment in her bedroom the a while back and brought it up in a civil way, but I was told to just leave it because it doesn't matter. I feel so frustrated.

I have started trying to ask my mom for help with these fights, and she will try and stop my sister sometimes, but most of the time I just get fought with and it hurts so much, as if nothing I do matters.

I overheard some insults on instagtam the other day, and my sister and I were fighting that same evening in the kitchen about her not doing what my mom asked her to do. She escalated the situation by deciding to fat shame me, something she does often. I am not what I would consider fat, but I am insecure about my weight, and she is super skinny.

I decided that I had had enough and decided to use an insult I had come accross. I said to her, ""You know what sister's name, there is a tree somewhere out there in the world. This tree's sole purpose in it's life is to replace the oxygen that you waste, go find your tree and apologize to it.""

It ended the argument really quickly and I won't lie, I was pretty happy with myself. My parents said that what I said made me am Asshole. It didn't seem to bother her much because she is unphased by everything, but I feel like it might have been crossing a line.

I (25M) am getting married next month to my fiancé (26F). We have been planning our wedding for over a year and we have a strict guest limit of 100 people due to the venue and our budget. We decided to invite only our closest family and friends, and we had to make some tough choices about who to include or exclude. 

One of the people we decided not to invite was my cousin (28M). He and I were never close growing up, and he has always been rude and disrespectful to me and my fiancé. He has made fun of our relationship, called us names, spread rumors about us, and tried to sabotage our engagement party. He is also a notorious troublemaker who likes to cause drama and start fights at family gatherings. He has been banned from several relatives’ homes for his behavior. 

My aunt (his mom) called me yesterday and demanded to know why I didn’t send him an invitation. She said he was hurt and angry that I excluded him from such an important event in my life. She said he deserved to be there as my family and that I was being selfish and petty. She also threatened to boycott the wedding if I didn’t change my mind. 

I told her that I was sorry she felt that way, but I had no intention of inviting him. I said he had done nothing but disrespect me and my fianceé and I didn’t want him to ruin our special day. I said it was my wedding and I had the right to decide who to invite or not. I said I loved her and hoped she would still come, but I understood if she chose not to. 

She hung up on me and later sent me a long text message calling me a horrible person and a bad cousin. She said I was breaking the family apart and that I would regret my decision. She also said she was not coming to the wedding and neither were any of her other relatives who sided with her. 

I feel bad that I upset her and caused a rift in the family, but I also feel like I don’t owe my cousin anything after how he treated me. My fiancé supports me and says he doesn’t want him there either. Most of my other relatives are on my side too, but some think I should have invited him to keep the peace.

"AITA for finally telling my brother the truth, but throwing my parents under the bus to do so?","ESH... your brother is trying to justify stealing and there is zero excuse for it.  But, your parents should have helped him find his niche in the company.   Everyone has a talent, his was just undiscovered.",2,0,2110,2110,"AITA for finally telling my brother the truth, but throwing my parents under the bus to do so?

I (36m) used to run a company with my (35m) brother and both my parents. It was supposed to be the dream of the sons taking over the family business. I had the ability to work in every department, so over the course of the last 10 years I progressed to running the company. My brother, who worked harder than anyone else, floundered with any real responsibility. He was the ultimate task doer, but ask him to manage anyone or anything, and it would be a dumpster fire.

My parents would protect my brother by tying my hands behind my back in regards to saying anything bad to my brother about the quality of his work, or how he was failing at being a manager. My parents did not want his feelings to be hurt. My brother would get moved to a different department, or have his job description change so he wasn't in charge of anything that would hurt the company. They would never tell him he wasn't doing his job right, they would never tell him he sucked at his job. It was easier for  them to lie to him, so they could avoid any conflict or hurt feelings.

I was complicit in this. I kept up the lies, I played the game. Resentments grew. My brother was still getting paid the same as me, I was running the company, at this point he was basically still in a entry level position. So 2 years ago I started a different company and left the family one. Less than a year later, my parents asked me to come back. I accepted on the condition that my brother would be bought out of the company. They agreed.

So with my brother being bought out, I am now running the company solo, we gave him a group of our customers that he now services under his own company name, life is good, or so I though.....

I found out by one of my employees, that my brother has been stealing product out of our warehouse. They were under the impression that we had some sort of deal worked out with me because we were family. NOPE..... He was just plain stealing.

So when I confront my brother, he admits to stealing, but went off on this rant on how I never respected him, that I was the biggest asshole because I was mean, and on and on. So then and there I decided to stop lying, and essentially told him all of the lies from the last 10 years. How he got the short end of the stick because no one ever told him what he was doing wrong. How our parents just didn't want to hurt his feelings, but knew he couldn't run the company. I was done lying, I just sat there and told the truth.

So my parents are now mad at me because he's mad. Like MAD MAD, and he has gone no contact with them, and they are worried that they wont be able to ever see him or their grandchildren again.

So AITA for finally telling my brother the truth, but throwing my parents under the bus to do so?

EDIT: To add to more information to this story, it was not like my brother was thrown into a situation without training. We provided informal training on how to learn more about the business (Like this is how we do the books, come with me on the jobsite so I can show you this). Formal training both trade specific and management courses. He was not thrown to the wolves, he just never cared to pick it up, or try to step up. 

I left the company because of the toxic environment and all of the built up resentments.

I came back to the company because my parents retirements are tied to the company and without a son to run it or a sale, they would have lost everything. I still run the other company I started.

Last, I knew I was an asshole for what I did to my brother. When I told him the truth, I was also apologizing to him for my part in all of it. I was asking if I was the asshole for throwing my parents under the bus in the truth/apology.",2110,"harleymomma45325","poolmoney1",0

"AITA for telling my boyfriend how I feel after he told me he’d rather be home drinking with his friends than going on a road trip with me?","Info:


Did you ask him ""is the time frame really ok?"" Or did you ask him about missing his drinking day?



NTA - he is a whiny ass honestly",3,0,1,1,"I (F23) and my boyfriend (M26) were planning to go on a road trip with a rented (and already paid) van so I can experience driving a bigger car before I eventually buy my own van. Since I don’t have any experience yet, I decided to ask my bf to come along so he could step in if I needed any help. We booked the trip weeks ago because of an incredible offer I found online. 

Since we are both studying, we had in mind, that we might need to cancel it under **one** specific circumstance: If any of us had an obligatory course on Fridays.

That’s not the case, but now my bf is complaining about other problems – which were aware of before booking the van. He and his friends have a tradition on the 1st of May to wander around town with handcarts, alcohol, and a grill to get drunk and have a great time. He sees some of his friends only once a year during this occasion and I know it’s important to him. That’s why I specifically asked him if he was okay with booking a vacation over this period. He said yes. 

Then, his friends reminded him about the 1st of May, and I reminded him we wouldn’t be in town. (The pick-up is 700 km away and the return is 350 km away – that’s why it’s so cheap. So, coming home for just one day is not an option.) He has been very upset about this and told me on multiple occasions that he had trouble sleeping and was angry with himself because he forgot. I tried talking to him to find a solution, but we haven’t found one yet – except for canceling the vacation, which I don’t want to do. He assured me that he would come with me since he already agreed but kept complaining about missing out and him rather drinking with his friends than going on a road trip with me. He emphasized not wanting to go but still doing it for me. His behavior makes me feel like I’m punishing him and forcing him to come along with me and honestly, I don’t want to take him if he doesn’t want to go. 

I suggested, that I could ask someone else to come along instead but to stick with our original plan if I wouldn’t find someone else to fill in and he agreed. I already asked different people if they would like to come – but no one was free.

I told my bf about this and we had a fight since he says he only agreed on booking it if there was the possibility of canceling it. However, the only reason he and I agreed on was related to our careers and not drinking with friends. He made it clear he doesn’t want to go. I told him, I thought it was selfish of him to change his priorities since he knew how important it was to me and he agreed to everything weeks ago and even again a few days ago before I asked my friends to come along instead.

"AITA for telling another kid that nobody I know wanted their parents to divorce?","NTA. And at 8, even if his parents fight a lot, he probably still had hope that someday he'd have a happy family when it would be less fighting and more good times. Divorce to kids means that your whole world is being flipped upside down and nothing is ever going to be the same as it was before. Maybe eventually it will become more stable but if the kid is in the throes of it, he needs someone to validate his feelings and help him process. 

I will add, however, I don't know how you said it to Kai but maybe you made him feel worse and not better. If you were saying it from a place of empathy, as in ""welcome to the club, kid, it sucks but you'll get through it."" Or, if it was more of ""oh, yeah. This is actually worse than you think it is"" which might give him nightmares. Your words and intent matter in this case. OP, you aren't that clear about that so you might be a bit of an AH. Especially if you meant for Heather to overhear you.",1,0,2075,2075,"My parents are divorced. My dad is married to Heather. Heather has a nephew Kai who is 8. Kai's parents are going through a divorce right now and his mom is already seriously dating this guy who moved in with them. Kai is hating the whole thing. I'm not close to Heather or her family but was dragged along for a family party at her parents house Saturday (I'm 17 and still split time between my parents and was given no choice by my dad). Kai was upset and was talking about how much it sucked. I told him I got it. He said everyone in his family was telling him he should be happy because he wouldn't have to listen to his parents fight anymore and he should be happy they're divorcing. Kai said he wasn't. I told him neither was I. That I knew nobody with divorced parents who wanted them to be divorced or were happy about it. I told him most of my friends have divorced parents and all of them wish it hadn't happened. Heather and her sister overheard what I said to Kai and I got into so much trouble for saying it. They said it was unfair to make him think being unhappy with the divorce is okay and I shouldn't be saying that when I grew my family because of the divorce.

I do find this funny because Heather and her kids (her little demons as I call them in my head) were no great family addition. Most of the time I have to make sure none of my stuff has been broken or stolen and to never ever buy snacks for myself with my money because that stuff will be gone. I also get to hear about them getting suspended from school every time I'm at my dad's.

So I got a lecture and was told I was wrong and acting like a spoiled kid. I decided to just go to my mom's and not listen. Dad told me I should never have told Kai what I did.

"AITA for suggesting my stepson (16M) moves out?","YTA. Your stepdaughters came up with that idea of their own accord, and it was a plan that suited them both. Your stepson is old enough that if he WANTED to do the same he would have looked at how they had managed their living arrangements and said ""yup, I am gonna do that too"". However he didn't make that move, and having his stepmother suggest him going to live elsewhere is always going to look like you kicking him out. Normally I am very much in favour of step parents having the same authority as parents, but when it comes to suggesting a step child leaves for no other reason than making more room for their own child (which is at the heart of this given your statement about the unfairness of your son having to share) that's a very big no-no.",2,0,2864,2864,"My husband and I have 6 children total and live in 4 bedroom house. We have two sons together (8 & 6), I have a son from a previous relationship (15), and I have 3 step children (20F, 16M & 16F). We live in a 4 bedroom house and for most the time we lived there we had 2 kids per room with the youngest boys sharing, the older boys sharing and the girls sharing. 

Things changed a couple years ago. My oldest stepdaughter finished school and is attending university locally. The girls decided at this point that instead of sharing a bedroom at their dads and sharing a bedroom at their mums, they would each take 1 room as their permanent bedroom. So the 16 yr old lives with us full time and the 20 yr old lives with her mum full time. They both visit the other parents house regularly. 

My 16 yr old stepson has his own bedroom at his mum's house but still splits time between each parents house mostly 50/50. My son lives full time with us as he doesn't have much of a relationship with his dad. My son and stepson do not get on that well and they can often be heard screaming at each other in their bedroom. 

Recently, I asked my stepson why he doesn't move to live full time with his mum so he and my son can have a similar arrangement as their sisters. This way both of the boys would have their own rooms. He would obviously still visit like his older sister does and we could figure something out like a futon instead of a bed in their room so my son has more space when stepson's not there. 

My stepson overreacted to my suggestion and is trying to make out like I'm kicking him out, when really I'm just thinking of a better use of space. It's unfair that all the older kids but my son have their own rooms at one of their parents house. My son likes the idea and has brought it up to his stepbrother a few more times since I originally suggested it and it has caused arguments between them. He now seems to be considering it. 

My husband is angry with me for suggesting his son moving permanently to his mums. He thinks that he and his son would have a less close relationship if this happens (my husband favours his oldest son over our boys). He also thinks I'm making his son feel like he's being forced out. However, it was his daughters already doing the same thing that gave me the idea because it worked out well for them and they both seem happier. I'm also not forcing this to happen I was just suggesting it to him, it would be completely up to him. Is this a good plan or AITA for bringing it up?",2864,"Dazzling-Health-5147","brgtail1735",0

I found out my dad was way after I was already an adult and it explained a LOT.",1,0,2930,2930,"I (23F) am a college student and live with my mom and brother “Caden” (21M). Caden is very obsessed with seeming masculine, and he takes a lot of pride in his personal style. He has a decent following on YouTube  and TikTok, and his “brand” is basically about being a player and attracting girls.

Well, he was making a video yesterday with some fairly expensive jeans he copped from a local custom designer. They are light pink and he was having trouble finding a shirt to match. He came out to the kitchen complaining, and I told him to wear this tee I got for his birthday last month. I told him the pattern had some pink in it and would match well with pink jeans.

Caden immediately started yelling and kicking off. He insisted that they weren’t pink, and accused me of gaslighting him. He said they were red and I just had an agenda of masculating him. These jeans are literally rose pink, so I was definitely not gaslighting him.

He called our mom at work (this was during her lunch hour) and told her what I said. My mom took Caden’s side and accused me of raining on my brothers parade by making him feel bad about his new clothes. I replied that I don’t think guys wearing pink is bad, and Caden is just making drama over nothing.

Now Caden won’t wear the jeans, and because they aren’t returnable, my mom wants me to reimburse him the cost of the jeans. There’s no way I’m doing that.

If you’re not using the equipment you shouldn’t be on it taking up space. Everyone deserves equal opportunity to USE the machines at the gym. You wouldn’t throw your sweatshirt on a machine to hold it while you chat with a friend, so don’t park your ass on it to chat either.

My gym has a strict no sitting and texting on machines policy, same should go for sitting and chatting. It’s just plain rude to hog equipment when other people are waiting on your machine. Everyone should be expected to politely finish their sets, wipe down equipment, and move on.",43,0,2255,2255,"There are two lat pull down set-ups at our gym and it is a VERY busy gym. 

I (33F) was working out on a machine behind the lat pull downs and saw this lady (prob in her early 40s, very fit) sitting on one of the machines, chatting away, not doing a single rep. The other lat pull down was occupied by two guys going pretty hard. 

A little background: This lady is a repeat offender-she loves to sit on a machine-not use it- and chat with people…once the conversation is done she’ll eventually start her workout (the number of times I’ve waited for her on the leg abductor and leg press while she chatted away not using the machine…I digress…back to the story).

I saw a timid girl (probably late teens early 20s) shyly/very politely ask the lady if she could work in-the lady said no, that she hadn’t used it yet. The girl walked away, looking embarrassed.

I got hot. 

I called out to the lady and said with very clear irritation “excuse me, ma’am, hey. It’s  very busy right now. I’ve watched you sit on this machine for at least the last 5 minutes chatting to your buddy without doing a single rep. If you’re not going to use it, it’s f*****d up to not let someone else in.” 

The lady told me I was rude but got up and let the other girl (who mouthed me a “thank you”) in. 

The lady also reported me to management for “being rude” (didn’t affect my membership, just a quick word from an employee) and now this lady proceeds to glare at me anytime she sees me in the gym. 

When I told my friend they said that the lady was obviously messed up, but it was not my place to say anything to her. Also that my condescending tone would have riled anyone up.

I'm studying computer science and I'm currently doing an internship at a medium-sized company that hasn't laid off 30% of its employees (yet).

So, since I'm the one who knows about computers, my family sees me as their personal tech support. And my family is B.I.G. I live with my mom, my little brother, 2 of my aunts and their kids. The kids are lazy when it comes to tech shit because they know I'll do it for them, but my mom and aunts are beyond tech illiterate, they're tech morons.

I am constantly interrupted in my studies or word because my cousins forgot their Disney Plus profile pin, or my mom needs to reset her email password again, I actually set up a cloud password manager for them that they do not use because they always forget that it is an option. 

So a few weeks ago, one of my little cousins wanted me to help him reset a password after he got locked out of Google, and he aggressively knocked on my door demanding that I help him.  I asked him, ""Do I look like TS to you?"" and he said yes with a straight face.

So I got a domain and set up a help desk. Then I told my family that if they wanted any help from me, they should go to the website and submit a ticket for my help. My aunt said I was being ridiculous, but I was deadly serious.

In the following days, I would give them the cold shoulder if they tried to come to me with technical problems, and just tell them to submit a ticket and I would send them the solution by mail. Forgot your mail password? Too bad, use someone else's mail. Fortnite is lagging? Get a ticket and wait till I'm home. That helped me a lot.

But then yesterday I came back from the university and the whole house was sitting in the living room telling me to sit down. They were doing an INTERVENTION on me! WTF!?

I don't have any specific reason for not wanting children, I just lack the desire and I strongly believe that the question should be ""why do you want kids?"" instead of ""why don't you want kids?"".

My older sister, Sadie, was very vocal about wanting to have children in her early 20s, but now that she is in her late 20s, she changed her mind.

Our parents never liked that I don't want kids, but they didn't care much about it either, since they knew Sadie will give them grandchildren. But now that Sadie changed her mind, they are panicking.

They invited us both over to dinner, then ""confronted"" us on why we don't want to have children and demanded a reason. I told them I just simply lack the desire and I expected Sadie to do the same, but instead, she threw me under the bus.

She decided to perpetuate the childfree stereotype and said that she is too lazy and selfish to have children. She doesn't want to start her mornings with making breakfast, getting the kids ready and taking them to school, she is just too lazy for that and doesn't want to give up her nice vacations and hobbies.
 
Thanks to her, now our parents are bugging me too and believe I'm a selfish, lazy person. I told Sadie she was wrong for telling our parents that's her reason and she should've thought about me before opening her mouth.

Sadie said she has every right to tell our parents whatever she wants and it's not her fault they are the way they are and that I can't stand up for myself. AITA?

Edit: She called herself lazy and selfish and that's what I have a problem with.

Edit 2: Again: nobody has to give a reason why they don't want kids, so no, there is no such thing as an invalid reason.

AITA?

Edit: Forgot to mention what those expenses were the expenses in question was a title or medal that we had to go on stage and take these titles were based off of the nicknames each of us were given throughout our college year and we had to make a speech after taking our thing (idk what to call it) so I told them I don't want them to make a medal or title thing for me and they still made it I just didn't want to give the speech on stage

Edit: the reason why I stayed quiet after having a change of heart was because I was being kinda peer pressured into coming by my friend he said that there weren't enough people coming to the party so I at that time so him and rest of the guys would stop annoying me and after that I did intend to go for a while but then changed my mind",3,"pineboxwaiting","Chicken_Tugger",0

He is a very sassy and demanding dog, he will grunt at you for food, pets and walks. Like if I stop petting him, he will look at me and grunt to get me to continue.

We live very close to each other and I accompany them on their walks a few times a week. Emily likes to act like she and her dog are having actual conversations, which is fine at home, but weird in public. I asked her a few times before not to do it on our walks, but she just finds it funny.

Yesterday we sit down on a bench in the park in the middle of our walk and her dog wanted us to continue walking so he was grunting at us. Emily took this as an opportunity to pretend to have a conversation with him.

By conversation I mean something like this:

Emily: XY said this to me yesterday, can you imagine?

Dog: grunts 

Emily: Right?! That's what I said too.

Dog: grunts

Emily: I'm so happy you are on my side... and so on, and so on.

People walking by us were laughing at us and I asked Emily to stop, but she didn't. So I told her it's embarrassing and left her there.

I cannot imagine what living with you must be like.",1,0,896,896,"(i made a mistake in the title, sorry, it should be ""for giving away"")

My daughter (10) wanted a puppy for her birthday so my wife and I went to a shelter and picked a puppy for her, we made it very clear that she had to be responsible for it. That means that she'll have to clean after him, feed him and checking his water bowl, etc. We would hire a trainer and would take him to the vet when it was needed, but besides that she had to take care of it. 

During the first month things were okay, she did as she promised. But now (over two months since she got the puppy) she complains about having to clean when the dog poops or pees on the floor and when she had to take care of him. This week she reached the last straw because she forgot to give him water, my wife had to fill his bowl because she didn't do it. 

I told her this is enough because a dog is not a toy and she promised to be responsible. I contacted some friends/ family and asked them if they wanted the puppy. Finally a coworker said she wanted it and I took him to her house. 

My daughter is very sad now but I think she needs to learn a lesson here. My parents told me I was being unfair because deep down I knew that my daughter was gonna fail in being responsible and I set her up for failure. They think that as a dad I need to teach them but not punish them the first time they make a mistake. Are they right?

"AITA for asking my brother to help me around the house?","NTA. Kick him out. He is abusing you.",13,0,13,13,"Throwaway because my younger cousins follow my main. For context: I (21F, British) have lived alone since I was 19 after being kicked out by my abusive mother, she wasn’t the best then but it’s getting better now. Because of this, my brother (17M) has been no-contact with her since he was 14. It’s been a bumpy road but we‘re both on the way to recovery finally after a couple years. Anyway, recently my brother has come to live in my apartment due to a falling out between him and our father (I don’t know the details). It’s a one bedroom apartment as it’s the only thing I can afford with my pay grade which means he’s been sleeping on the pull-out couch in my living room for around a month.

At first, it was going okay, but now when I come home from University and work, I find clothes thrown around on the floors. He eats everything out of my fridge when he gets home from sixthform to the point where I’m having to hide some of my food around my bedroom to try and keep snacks for myself. On multiple occasions, I’ve come back from a late night shift at around 9PM to see him and his friends drunk and high on my couch, swearing unlike anything I’ve ever heard before. I try to make them leave, but my brother just gets up in my face (He is 6’3 and I am 5’7) and I leave them be as I am not one for confrontation — never have been and probably never will be.

Honestly, him having friends over wouldn’t be a problem for me if he wasn’t getting drunk and causing a racket, but many of my things like vases have already been smashed by him and I‘m not in the place to be able to afford replacements at the moment. I also have my final Uni exams in May so really need to sleep during the nights, but his frequent meet-ups with his friends are really affecting me mentally and my ability to keep my sleeping schedule.

I’ve asked him on multiple occasions to keep his space clean and to stop brining his friends over, at least until I finish my exams, but he just won’t listen. The same with the food, I ask if he can bring his own food home on his way back and he gets really defensive and says ‘why can’t you?’ ‘You’re my big sister, you should provide for me’ ect. I’ve spoken to my father, they’re in the ‘I won’t speak to him until he apologises’ phase, which is really annoying so he can’t go back there until they sort their business out, but I don’t know how long that will be.

I feel really guilty asking my brother to do all of this stuff, but I’m simply not able to hold up a two person household by myself yet. As for now, money really isn’t one of my main concerns, but more the stress and anxiety I feel every night after a long day realising I have to cook for my younger brother when I get in. I’m always extremely exhausted and I just can’t continue slaving after him until he finally goes to bed. Sorry for the long post, AITA?",13,"Snoo1560","throwaway88490",0

We still live in a resettlement apartment owned by my grandparents because I have to take care of them and my mom doesn't have enough money to move out.

When I turned 18, I went to a doctor once and he told me that I must do laser treatment or it won't disappear. But I didn't have money to do it so I refused. I went back to doing skincare and hoped for the best.

At this age, I still suffer from it but people around me don't talk about it anymore, I guess they're used to seeing my face covered with a ton of red spots. But the one who is annoyed by my scars is my mom. She always tells me how ugly I am with all those scars and blames me for how uncareful and stupid I am for having acne in the first place. I'm used to it but today I just talked back to her. I told her I'm sorry that I'm not good enough and not pretty enough. I told her that if she finds me that ugly, the best thing I could do to not let her see me again is to leave this house for good. She was shocked and said that I was rude to her. She told me how polite she was when talking to me and that I was a spoiled brat.

I don't know what to do anymore. I will apologize to her because after all, she is my mother but the things she said really hurt my feelings.

I’ve always said how precious it is to me for them to have a bond and something just for the two of them, since they aren’t related by blood. He is the only one to call her monkey. He is a 60 YO loud over the top man who yes, does yell when he talks. But he has never yelled at my daughter in anger. It’s always being sweet. “Monkey eat your lunch” “monkey it’s time to take your hiney to bed”. 

This has been the routine since the DAY she was born.

Yesterday her father, sent a serious of texts to my parents (baby grand parents) asking him not to call her monkey anymore after it’s been the norm for 14 months. because of this new tik tok video he found which says she will subconsciously think she’s a monkey when she’s older. 

My parents find it ridiculous and told him so.  I call her stinky butt is she going to think she’s a bum subconsciously? This is not a new trend… to parent by whatever tik tok video he sees that day. 

My stepfather is extremely hurt. The text messages insinuated that it wasn’t appropriate to call her anything but her name and it needed to stop.

i should also add about 3 months ago a rift formed between stepdad and baby’s father. Unrelated circumstances but my stepdad just really doesn’t like him anymore. They’re encouraging me to separate… the whole shebang.

after they got those texts a phone call argument started …. 

personally, i think it would be different if it wasn’t almost a year and a half later, and instead was the DAY he started with monkey. like a simple i don’t love that nickname do you mind changing it?

I miss those days of an epic MGS trailer being released and the speculation and fan theories that would arise.

I (33F) was working out on a machine behind the lat pull downs and saw this lady (prob in her early 40s, very fit) sitting on one of the machines, chatting away, not doing a single rep. The other lat pull down was occupied by two guys going pretty hard. 

A little background: This lady is a repeat offender-she loves to sit on a machine-not use it- and chat with people…once the conversation is done she’ll eventually start her workout (the number of times I’ve waited for her on the leg abductor and leg press while she chatted away not using the machine…I digress…back to the story).

I saw a timid girl (probably late teens early 20s) shyly/very politely ask the lady if she could work in-the lady said no, that she hadn’t used it yet. The girl walked away, looking embarrassed.

I got hot. 

I called out to the lady and said with very clear irritation “excuse me, ma’am, hey. It’s  very busy right now. I’ve watched you sit on this machine for at least the last 5 minutes chatting to your buddy without doing a single rep. If you’re not going to use it, it’s f*****d up to not let someone else in.” 

The lady told me I was rude but got up and let the other girl (who mouthed me a “thank you”) in. 

The lady also reported me to management for “being rude” (didn’t affect my membership, just a quick word from an employee) and now this lady proceeds to glare at me anytime she sees me in the gym.

He tried to reach out after that, but his dad completely ignored him and wanted nothing to do with him. My boyfriend was really depressed about it, but he eventually got over it. I remember one night we all got drunk (we're apartment sharing with friends) and he told us that he was dead to his father, and that stuck with me.

Yesterday, he just showed up, my boyfriend's dad, that is. Myself and one of our roommates were the only people home. I answered the door, but I didn't let him in. He said he wanted to talk to his son and I said ""oh, your dead son?"" He must not have remembered or understood the reference, because he went completely pale and asked how/when he died. He looked almost as upset as my boyfriend had been, so I decided to let him stew in it.

I told him a fake story. He looked like he was going to throw up, and he asked if he could come in and have some water. I reluctantly let him, because he seemed very ill. Once inside, my roommate saw us and asked what was going on. My boyfriend's dad asked if he knew his son, and my roommate was super confused and it quickly came out that my boyfriend wasn't actually dead.

My boyfriend's dad was furious. He said I was a sick person with a hateful heart. I told him he said his son was dead to him, so why would he even care. He said he made a mistake in a moment of anger, but I made a cold-blooded decision. My roommate also said that what I did was fucked up.

I went to our room and called my boyfriend, who said to make sure his dad left before he came home, which I did, and he did, reluctantly. I didn't tell my boyfriend about the dead thing, just that he showed up and seemed to regret things. My boyfriend is shocked by his dad just showing up and I don't want to pile more on. My roommate said I was a huge asshole because ""no one deserves that,"" but I'm not sure. He did look so sick, but part of me thinks he brought it all upon himself. I don't know.

Edit: One of you made a compelling case to tell my boyfriend as soon as possible about telling his dad he was dead. He wanted to know what his dad's reaction was and kept asking if he said anything other than asking for more information before he found out it was a lie. He only really asked questions like ""When? How? Was it sudden?"" and such, and my boyfriend was pretty disappointed by that. He's pretty depressed this morning.",171,"blockparted","NotVeryFriend",0

"AITA For Telling My Mother In Law That I Don't Like Her Food","NTA OP",2,0,2617,2617,"My husband (23) and I (21) both come form different cultures for example I am actually an immigrat and only moved to America when I was just 12 years old.

There is alot of things my husband and his family does differently than mine, things that I'm not quite accustomed to.

One being how they prepare and season their food, to me its just super bland and the stuff the choose of food combinations just doesn't seem to go together.

For example My mil > (mother in law) puts mayo on literally everything I even seen her make a tortilla pizza as mayo as her base which she offered to me. 

Each time she offers me food I always make up some kinda excuse to avoid eating it and try to be as polite as possible about it.

But unfortunately for me after I invited her to dinner she felt compelled to do the same for me even when I told her it's not necessary.

The next day after the dinner we had together she started making plans with my husband, when my husband brought it up to me I told him I really didn't want to go to which he replied my mom's food is not that bad could you please just deal with it for one day.

Now in most cases I would've just suck it up un order to maintain a good relationship with my mil but I'm pregnant in my first trimester and am feeling extra nauseous, I honestly don't think I'd be able to keep the food down in the condition I'm in.

My husband grew up eating her good which is maybe why he doesn't think it's that bad, I mean even my family thinks so when my mom invited her over for a family get together she brought some pasta which sauce tasted like a whole package of ketchup was dump in it. 

I ended up vanting to my sisters and mom about the issue and they all give me the advice to just be honest and my mom even said that if I don't be honest now it's something I'll have to deal with for the rest of my life. 

So I decided to call her and express to her that I'm not accustomed to eating the type of foods she is use to making and since I'm pregnant it'll be really hard for me to swallow because of my nausea, I even offered to teach her the recipes from my homeland that she seemed to really enjoy.

It didn't go to well she was really offended and told me that she'll never cook for my ungrateful ass again and told my husband.

My husband is really disappointed in me because he felt like I should've just pretended to keep the peace and is upset that now my mil doesn't even want to invite me over again.

I feel super bad now and seriously want to know if I'm the asshole in this situation or if I was being too mean or disrespectful.

Am I in the wrong?


Update 

I have invited my mother in law out to a tea Cafe and spoke to her in person.

I was able to explain myself better and I choose not to back down on me not liking the type of foods she cooks.

I'm sorry but like this is my life and I'm choosing not to live the rest of my future being pressured into eating foods I do not like and am also choosing to live my relationship based on honesty.

I had an honest discussion with my mil and explained to her that I love her as a person and appreciate the time and effort she puts into making my husband and I food but I honestly do not like the type of food she chooses to make.

I explained to her that it doesn't make her any less of a person or a bad cook it's just my personal preferences.

She took it extremely well this time and apologized for insulting me and told me that she never been the best cook and would love to take me up on my offer to learn some meals from my homeland.

I ended up suggesting that we take cooking classes together and she loved the idea. 

I think the little bump in the road gave us a stronger bond and I am glad we were able to patch things up.

I personally don't think the advice I was getting from the majority of this sub was good advice and would recommend to anyone in my situation to be honest and kind.

I even made it known to my mother in law that I'd myself would appreciate the same kinda honestly coming from me and if she ever disliked food I made or even a gift I gave to please let me know so I can make or get something she'd enjoy.

She even made jokes about previous gifts I got her lol.",2617,"SammiiSamantha","Ok_Being_Here",0

It kind of sounds like you have created a situation where you cannot be pleased, and your husband cannot win. And you both seem really bitter about it and blame each other for it.

At the same time though you don’t seem to be very supportive about the situation either, or really acknowledge that he is hurt, and trying his best to prove to her that he actually does live there while also working hard and traveling to provide for the family.

She got mad at me and said I was judging her for her culture (She’s Indian) and that this was normal in Indian households.

I thought maybe I was being culturally insensitive so I googled about it but found nothing. After our talk, the next morning she sent me multiple paragraphs about how I will never understand her culture and that I should just accept her.

For context, my girlfriend has really strict traditional indian parents who are helicopter parents in every sense of the word. They are also super toxic and judgmental.

I(35M) was asked by my wife(34F) about the bonus I received at work this year. When I told her about what I got, she asked me if I could loan her $10k. Since she's never asked me for this before I asked what it was for. She said it was to ""help"" her brother buy a house, and she would give him the loan and she would pay me back in monthly installments in $1k. When I asked why she wouldn't just loan him directly, she said it was because she wanted some buffer in her own finances(we have a joint account for bills but don't really mix finances). I had a bunch of questions:

Is this a gift? No, he says he will pay me back.

How would we pay this to him? She would send him the money(He lives in another country).

When is he buying the house? He's just putting a down payment on the build. It's not built yet.

When is he planning on paying you back? He'll pay it back but no idea when.

Wife is adamant that she'll pay me back, and handle it if her brother decides not to pay back. I was really concerned that her brother might not pay her back and I told her as much. My big concern is that he'll pull a ""you're married to a rich American and so I don't have to pay you back"" line on her. There's no real recourse if he doesn't and I don't think that they're really that close. Plus he lives on the other side of the planet(China). I've had a lot of questions and concerns as I've been burned loaning friends/family money in the past and my wife finally just said she wasn't going to loan him money and that she now can't rely on me for financial aid anymore(we share bills, but I pay about 75% of everything as I make more) . I've offered alternatives but wife shut it down. Now she's mad and isn't really talking to me. She says that she doesn't want to talk about it anymore. AITA here?

I think I might be because:

I can probably swing this

Wife is guaranteeing it.

I might not be because:

It's a bad idea to loan money to family.

There's no recourse if it isn't paid back.

She maybe br in a timewarp.",6,0,2874,2874,"My husband and I have three biological children together, he adopted my child from a prior relationship and I am a stepmother to his adult child. My husband was divorced from my stepdaughter's mom. She was 8 when my husband and I became serious and my son was still a baby. Not long after my stepdaughter's mom died. My husband and I had talked about marrying before she died and we delayed it for a couple of years to allow my stepdaughter time to grieve and adjust to the changes in her life. This was with the help of therapy, of course. We knew a child who lost someone so close would need extra help.

Now my stepdaughter is 20, my son is 12 and our children together are 7, 6 and 4.

So what happened here is my stepdaughter and her boyfriend recently moved into a house together. She asked for help setting up their dining room and we all went over to help her. Her house was covered in photos. The landing had them, living room, kitchen, etc. There was not a single photo of her siblings in the house, or me, but it was not seeing one of the kids that led to this. She had her parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, her cousins, and friends. But there was no sign of the kids anywhere. All of the photos with her dad were older ones, from before we met. My 12 year old, 7 and 6 year old's noticed because they were excited to look around her house. I couldn't help but notice because her boyfriend had so many of his siblings and because there were some, what felt like deliberate choices, to make sure she used photos that didn't contain her siblings. Including extended family photos from years ago with my husband's side that were taken before her dad and I met. And we know she has photos with her siblings.

I always knew she wasn't super crazy about her siblings. I always hoped as she got older she would feel love for them. But it feels like she doesn't think of them as family or as special enough to be included. The three kids who noticed were hurt. My husband tried to assure them it was likely an oversight on her part and he called her the next day to ask. She said she had only wanted photos with people she considered family and she didn't consider us family.

We were all invited to her housewarming party. But the kids did not want to go. My husband and ILs were shocked and said they had to go of course. I argued that they didn't and I told him I would stay home with them. They argued back to me that the kids needed to be. I said they did not need to be there and I wouldn't force them to go when they already feel hurt. My husband and ILs think I'm unreasonable.

"AITA for choosing not to pay for my daughter's university fees despite paying for her brothers?","YTA you clearly have not done an ounce of research in what an English degree actually is and what you can do with it. That’s one of the most broadly used degrees out there. She can teach, she can write, she can be a librarian, she could be an archivist, she could pursue it further in graduate school and go into the academic world, she could go into marketing, she could go in to HR, she could really go into anything in the corporate world because an English degree is seen as desirable because it shows a broad range of literary and communication skills. It’s also important to remember that you go to college and get a degree for a job that you have a passion in, not solely for the money. Of course you want to make sure that you can have a job, but what’s the point if you spend your life miserable not doing some thing you like? The double standard it definitely makes you the AH, if your daughter is passionate about getting an English degree then that’s what she should do. I just recently attended a seminar at my graduate university with a man that has his PhD in early modern literature, and he went on to be one of the most successful businessmen in the pharmaceutical world. Don’t talk about things you don’t understand, English degrees lead to a lot",3,0,3369,3369,"My (57M) daughter Jane (21F) has recently been accepted into the university of her choice ,now me and my wife (55F) are glad with this news , the only thing is that Jane got accepted to do an English degree.

Now Jane, compared to her two brothers Mark (28M) and Leo (30M) was quite late in applying to university. When me and my wife asked her to start at 18 she claimed that she was not ready and wanted to have a ""little rest"", a little rest being going out with friends and travelling the whole of last year with her boyfriend.

It should be noted that I supplied Jane with all the money needed for her little rest .

Now me and my wife have nothing against Jane doing what she did, she's young and young people live to explore and do what they do, however before me and my wife allowed for Jane to do her thing we made her promise that when she did apply to university it was for a degree that was worth it - Jane was going through a weird phase where she wanted to be many things that were more on the creative side.

Fast forward a year later we find out that Jane's gone behind our backs and applied for an English degree.

Both Leo and Mark took medical degrees and are now very good, well payed doctors. One would think that this would motivate Janet to go on the same path but instead she has decided to be ""herself"".

I sat down Jane last night and told her that if she decided to go through with the English degree, I would not support her at all and that she would have to take out her own student loan, at this she began crying claiming that I was the ""worst dad ever"" and had always favoured her brothers over her (because I had paid for their university fees) - now this is totally incorrect I did literally pay for her travel all of last year.

My sons think that I'm being too harsh and that I should simply support Jane regardless of what she chooses, but is it too much to ask of my daughter to follow through with an actually useful degree?

EDIT: No, my daughter's year of travel does not add up to her brothers tuition fees, not even close. For those wondering I work as a cardiologist. 

Me not wanting my daughter to do an English degree is not because I'm sexist but because I want her to do something useful which she can live off instead of depending on me for the rest of her life.

When we got back home Amy asked to go upstairs to talk. She then told me it was kinda shitty what I did and that I could've just said ""yes"". I told her that anna is not really mine so I don't think I did anything bad. She's upset with me now, was I wrong here?


I don't hate the kids, i don't even hate kids in general, i just don't like the idea of having kids of my own. I do care and love nick and Anna. When I started dating Amy she introduced me as Tyler to them and they just stick with it, they call me by my name and that's fine. When either one of them introduce me to their friends they say ""my mom's bf"" not dad, they don't want me to be a ""dad"" and I don't want to either. We're good. 

I do however take care of them because theyre kids and they need to be taken care of, i did since I know them, but that doesn't mean we have to pretend that I'm their dad if neither of us want to",1984,"EnthusiasmOk8017","Terrible-Action-7700",0

I 22m have been married to my wife Lani22 for 8 months but together since highschool. We have a one year old daughter together. We live on the same property as her parents,  but in a different house.

Lani has 4 younger siblings who live in the other house ages 13, 12, 10, and 7. Moving into the property we did agree to sometimes watch the kids. We had also discussed with MIL her being home more when the baby is born, which she agreed. MIL works at a casino, and since we’ve been staying there she’s turned that into her job, and hobby. Working, then getting drunk and high hanging out after work. Since we’ve had our daughter this has became harder and harder to Maintain all the children while working and taking care of our child. I brought this up to her the other day how we felt she was taking advantage and how she really needed to be home more since we have a baby of our own. She got angry and said we agreed to help watch the kids and how nice she is for letting us rent out her other trailer. I then said,  we had agreed to watch them sometimes, but it isn’t our job to watch YOUR kids.

This really pissed her off, and caused a huge argument. She went on this huge rant how bills need to be paid, and how a 13 year old can’t be left alone with 3 younger kids. She’s also threatening to raise our rent. I really don’t think it is a unreasonable request to ask her to watch her own kids.

You agreed to go on a “family” vacation. That means spending time with…the family. If you need that much alone time you should not agree to go on family vacations, especially if you live far away from said family. 

I understand this is not yet OP’s family. Still, they agreed to go on the family vacation. 

The bathroom thing was too much. I don’t blame OP for being pissed about that. I’m betting the family was doing it to give OP a hard time, though, since OP had already discussed their discontent about it with their fiancé.

YTA, OP. Next time go on a separate vacation.",-4,0,2917,2917,"My fiance's family invited us to go with them on a little vacation. They told us not to worry about money because they covered the air bnb so all we would have to pay for is gas. It's a 19hr car drive. We arrived last Wednesday.

My in laws are so overbearing. Like if I go and take a shower, they are knocking on the door within 3 minutes to check on me. If I go to the bedroom to have a minute to myself, they are yelling up to me within 5 minutes to see if I'm good. If I say I need to go for a walk to clear my head, they follow me and make it a family thing. If I want to go site see they immediately get ready to go too and coerce us to go to the sites they think I will enjoy, versus what I would actually like. They sit there and talk to me and won't let me go to bed until after midnight and then they are up knocking on the door at 6am to get me and my fiance downstairs for coffee. And they literally do not stop talking from sun up to sun down.

I'm an introvert. I need space to refill my social bar and since I've been here, I haven't had a moment to myself. I mean not even being able to take a shower without being harassed is pissing me the fuck off. I've talked to my fiance about it several times and have told him more than once I need ""me time"". I need to stop being followed. I need to decompress. His way of combating this was to be up my ass 24/7 and continuously asking if I'm okay or to bitch to me about how annoyed he is becoming. Not helping at all. I've told him that. But after being followed when I was on the phone and having his mother try talking over the conversation I was having, it was the final straw. I packed my stuff and went to a hotel by myself. The $250 of my money to get home was now spent because I needed to get away before I lost it. My fiance knew I was beyond touched out and I warned him this was going to happen but apparently he didn't believe me. So now he's shocked that I would do this and make everything awkward for him and spend my portion of the trip money. AITA?

ETA: I mentioned to my in laws directly a few times that I needed space to decompress. Even when stating I needed to go on a walk to clear my head, they took it as an invitation to come along, despite me stating I needed space. Or like when I went to the bedroom, I announced it to the entire room that I needed a minute, and they proceeded to continuously yell up to me to make sure I was good. So they were fully aware that I was getting touched out but it seems like in their head that meant that they needed to helicopter and make sure I was okay by tagging along and watching me. We had plenty of money to get home. We set aside a specific set of money for the gas back.

"AITA for leaving my friends party after they expected their guests to pay for drinks?","NTA

This sounds like they decided to use their party as a money making opportunity.   
Leaving was a good move.",6,0,6647,6647,"This past weekend my wife (41F) I (42M) attended one of my friends party's that I was invited to. For context my friend (42M) his gf (48F) and their two friends (also mid 40's M&F) were hosting this party the **4 of them together.**

A few weeks ago when I received the invitation I realized that it said on it something along the lines of ""please be prepared to purchase your own drinks"". Didn't think much of it at the time considering I just thought they were hiring a bar tender or something, but fast forward to the day of the party.

I arrive with my wife and it's my friend and his gf standing behind their kitchen counter that they were using as their ""bar"", making/charging the guests for drinks. Now I was confused for a few reasons...

1, the fact that this party was held at my friends house, it's not like this was at an event space or something where this would be normal imo. 2, there was no bar tender that they hired or anything like that. It was literally 2 of the 4 of them standing in the kitchen at a time making drinks for people and then charging them accordingly (drinks were all under $10).

Now idk if this is actually a common thing, but I have never in my 42 years of living been to a ""party"" at a friends house where the hosts are charging you themselves for drinks.

I've had multiple parties over the years, that I have invited my friend and his gf to in which they have attended, and I've never charged **ANYONE** for drinks ever. I've always bought all the drinks myself and had an open bar type of situation. Where my guests can make there own drinks. I even had a proper bar tender once and still no one was charged, it was an open bar.

I honestly felt like my friend, his gf and their friends were all trying to make a quick buck off of their guests who attended. Clearly to cover to cost of the drinks. Which yeah I understand that booze isn't cheap these days but we're talking splitting the cost of whatever they bought between **4 PEOPLE**. Like in my opinion if you can't afford to supply drinks at your party, why are you having a party in the first place?

This also wasn't for charity or anything the money made off of the drinks was for them to split.

My wife and I bought one drink each, stayed for about an hour or so, and said our goodbyes. When we were leaving my friend asked why we didn't have that much to drink? I told him because I think it's ridiculous that they are charging their close friends for drinks. He called me cheap and an unsupportive friend. I assured him that i'm not, if the charging of drinks was for a good cause (like profits go to charity or something) of course i'd buy drinks.

I told him I find the fact that they are charging for drinks, and keeping the money for themselves ridiculous and taking advantage of their friends. Anyway now my friend and his gf are butt hurt about this and have been calling me an AH to our mutual friends. AITA here?

(EDIT: Wow! I did not expect this post to blow up like this but thank you guys.

Lily is a bully. I have met her a handful of times and she is always making fun of Eni, who is a little fat, Lily's always telling that bad pig jokes and she even gave Eni a nickname, Pigni.
I have complained to Tom and Tom's mom that Lily's jokes weren't funny and she should stop, but they always said she was just joking. I told Eni that she should return the jokes to Lily, but she can never think of anything to say.
Last year I was invited to Tom's family's Christmas party, everything was fine until Lily said something like ""Oh God Eni, you've already eaten so much, at this pace you'll stop being Pigni to become Whalni"" and she laugh with the children at the party. I was furious and Eni and Tom gave a fake laugh and said that Eni was 4 months pregnant. When we were all congratulating them, Lily said ""wow, at least now you can excuse yourself when people see you eating like a pig."" I got furious again but Eni asked me to just let it go but I know how much that jokes hurt her. So I went back to having a talk with Tom and his mother about why Lily's teasing had to stop.
 Well, this weekend was Eni's babyshower, we were having a good time until Lily told another joke about how ""fat"" Eni had gotten, I had enough so I laughed so loud to attract attention and said ""Oh Lily, you're so funny, especially when you finish your jokes with that ugly pig laugh, sometimes I think people laugh more at your laugh than at your joke."" Lily got super serious and she told me it wasn't funny, to which I said ""come on, it's a joke"" and imitated her laugh, the kids at the party laughed too and Lily ran away while she cried. Tom's mother scolded me for the joke and I asked her why Lily's jokes were funny but mine weren't, if they both had a pig joke in it, and her mother couldn't answer me. I told her that every time I heard Lily tell a joke about Eni, I would return the joke. Eni told me that I shouldn't have done that, but I could see her hold back her laughter along with the other guests, but I'm tired of Eni being walked over.

I was really young when we first started dating and the nagging of my MIL, wanting us to have kids early, always bothered me. I took my complaints to my fiancé but he dismissed me saying that i should ""understand his mother's ways"". I didn't get her hopes up about me having kids, because i always said that i wanted to mature enough to be able to raise a kid.

As i said, i just dismissed her nagging, until last week.

My fiancé came home from work (that btw he works with his mother), saying: ""I was with mom all that in the office,and after she told me some things i came to the conclusion that you should stop taking your birth control pills"". Unbelievable. Didn't even want to argue about something this ridiculous.

Time passed and we didn't touch this issue anymore.

The weekend came, and we went to visit my MIL's house, she took me to her room saying she needed to have a word with me and my fiancé.

She sat down on the bed and said: ""I had a discussion with Luiz (my fiancé's name), and i told him about my concern with you guys not having children at the appropriate age. Who knows if you're going to be able to have children with this disease of yours? As for now, he will no longer allow you to buy the birth control pills per my request""

(He never buyed them for me, i work 9 hours a day and everything i buy for myself comes from my money)

About ""my disease"": It's a disease that all the women in my father's side had: Uterus Cancer. My great-great-grandmother passed due to it, my great-grandmother too and my grandma had it after giving birth to my father, but the doctors took the uterus out before the cancer could spread further. My grandma was always cautious with me. Never had any issues, and i go to the gynecologist 2 times a year to do exams.

 I got enraged, and looked at my fiancé who was sitting beside her, and he just averted his eyes.

""you will regret leaving the thoughts of having kids after your graduation, because god time is now and i got a revelation from the pastor that one of my family members is going to try to have kids and it's not gonna be able to. I'm sure that person is you, and i'm worried for my son. I can't leave this marriage be if your thoughts don't align.""

When she said that last line, i exploded, saying ""Are you so desperate for me to sit on your son's cock and have a baby so what? It's not your business if we're having kids or not or if we're having sex or not, this must be a joke"".

The argument escalated but i don't remember much because i got so enraged that i started trembling and had to go home to calm myself down alone, as i left my fiancé there.

When he came home, he was pissed off saying that i disrespected his mother and that if i didn't apologise he would consider breaking off the engagement. Honestly am not making any effort to set things straight as i'm very offended by everything she said.

When talking about my financial aid, my mom was constantly talking about how she was gonna take it from my account (we had a shared account at the time as I had just turned 18 a couple months before this) and how she would send me money every week or basically as she saw fit. I was uncomfortable with this as she has made my sister take out loans to pay for their Disney vacation and use her aid to buy her new sewing machine to which my dad had to pay her back both times. I tried to say something at first but she quickly shut it down. After talking to my sister and dad, they advised me to make my own account for the money to go to.

"AITA for increasing a family members rent","""However, since the cousin has lived with us these past few years he only works for the summer months and some of the fall months. Prob a total of 4-5 months of the year and goes on EI for the rest of the year without trying to look for a job.""

So, I don't think you're wrong to raise the rent to something more in line with local prices, but this particular part of your post bothered me, because  you seem to think your husband's cousin is going onto unemployment and not working more so he can afford to pay you more because he's lazy or refuses to work. By ""summer and some of the fall months"", it sounds to me like cousin is working a seasonal agricultural job, which does have a limited run of when crops can be harvested and processed. It's *very* common in that field to hire on work crews for the season, lay them off during the off-season during which they're eligible to collect unemployment, and bring them back when the season starts back up again, and start and end dates are very much dependent on that year's crop. Now, maybe he can find a different seasonal position with dates opposite his current one, but very few non-agricultural employers are going to want to hire someone on for a regular position only to have them fuck off to another job for several months at a time. That's not to say it can't be done, especially if you guys live in a college town where employers are used to people  coming in for a few months between semesters and don't expect them to stick it out for a full year. I'm just saying it may be more difficult, and not just down to the cousin being lazy as you seem to imply. What cousin *can* do, since a lot of these seasonal ag positions involve overtime and lots of hours during the season, is plan his savings better during the season in order to supplement his budget during the off season. My position in the ag industry is now year round, but during seasonal rush when we're working 7 days a week and there's no time off to blow your paycheck at the bar or vacations or whatever, I can easily bank 15k or more over the season, allowing me to be more generous with my off season budget and spending.

NTA, and you should definitely sit down with your husband and then the two of you with the cousin to find a more fair rent price, but don't go into it with this attitude that cousin is ""lazy and just doesn't want to work"".",18,0,569,569,"My (f28 ) husbands (m32) cousin (m36) has lived in our basement suite for a few years and we have always cut him a deal on rent. Last spring we moved to a new house and he came with us renting our 2 bedroom basement suite for $1150 (no contract). For reference a suite this new and large are going for $2000+ in our area. Prior to this he was living in the 1 basement suite of our previous house, for $800 (we rented it out for $1300 as soon as he moved out with us). 

My husband wants to charge him so little because “hes family and he can’t afford more” However, since the cousin has lived with us these past few years he only works for the summer months and some of the fall months. Prob a total of 4-5 months of the year and goes on EI for the rest of the year without trying to look for a job. I understand he is family but this kind of bothers me as he is a 36 yo man that does not feel like working and we’re losing out on large rental income that could help with our bills. We are not well off by any means. We work very hard and have middle class jobs. 

Another thing that bothers me is that my husband and I maintain our big beautiful yard and the cousin has even made comments to me how he is not responsible for helping with yard work (even though he spends a lot of time outside enjoying that yard and I also never even asked him to help with yard work). You’d think for such a discounted rate he’d be willing to help out a bit (again we’ve never asked this of him). He also made statements to me in the past how he “pays the mortgage” for us. Which is not nearly true. 

Additionally, now my younger sister (f21) got a job offer in our city and we coincidentally we will have that previous $1300 basement suite for rent. I want to help her out by renting it cheaper. However, financially we can’t offer much of a discounted rental rate mostly due to my husbands cousin pretty much getting a $1000 dollar discount on rent each month. 

I don’t want my little sister renting out a 1 bedroom $1300 suite while his 36 yo adult cousin rents out a huge 2 bedroom $1050 basement suite. Even if my sister doesn’t move here I want to increase his rent. So AITA if I want to increase his rent by maybe like $200 each month? (Again there’s no contract). Wondering what everyone’s thoughts are on this.

So I will be walked down the aisle by my dad, followed by my fiance being walked by his mom. I'm going to dance with my dad for a father-daughter dance at the same time my fiance dances with his mom. We had talked about doing that before we asked our respective parent to do it. Both agreed and were touched. My dad especially because he didn't think he would be fulfilling any of the traditional father of the bride duties, since I'm not all that traditional. But I love my dad and I thought it would be nice for us to do this while my fiance and his mom have their moments.

The thing is, I do have a stepdad. He's been married to my mom since I was 4 and he has always wanted to be more to me than just my stepdad I don't really like. But he has always felt a little too suffocating, a little too traditional (I know he tried to get my dad to leave me alone for him to raise with my mom so I could have a traditional family unit), and generally not someone I enjoy spending time with. He's been there as long as I can remember but I can't say that's a good thing for me. Even though I spent just as much time with my dad as I did with my mom, my stepdad has always believed himself to be my primary father figure, and that he and my mom were more important in my life and childhood than my dad.

This has never been true. My dad has always been there. He has never stepped out of my life or taken being my dad for granted. It always bothered me how my stepdad seemed to view my dad and that my mom let it happen. As an adult I have a cordial-ish relationship with the both of them and I don't have a relationship with my half siblings who are 19f, 18m and 16f. The reason being they dislike me for how I treat their dad. In their eyes I should be closer to him and they have let me know that before.

My stepdad asked me the other day why he hadn't heard from me on his father of the bride duties and I told him it was because he had none. He started a lecture on the importance of the position and I said my dad was the father of the bride, so he was doing it. Stepdad said he expected to do it. I told him I wasn't comfortable doing it with him. He asked why not both and let people see the man who raised me doing it alongside the bio dad. I told him that wasn't happening and he (and my mom when she found out) told me I should be ashamed for taking him for granted and for putting blood before real family. He said I was humiliating him by not asking him. Mom said I was disrespecting them both because she chose him.

TLDR; Family has talk about older brother spending habits and gets into a heated argument where I question what had my brother put into to help his career, all he does is video games and work. I argue that he has not scraficed enough to even start his career and it gets heated.


Context: My brother has recently graduated and he has been having issue with spending money throughout all 4 years. When he started to get credit cards, he maxed them out. My parents would tell him be better at spending or we will lock your card blah blah. (My father was helping to pay the credit card bills). It continuously went into this cycle of my brother spending more than his PT job and my parents ended up having to talk to him basically every 3 months.

I knew where this was heading.I learned this past 3 months,my brother's spending habits ended up almost totaling 5 grand. My parents kept asking me how do we teach your brother to be a little bit more responsible with money, how do we help him?

This is where shit kinda went loose.I usually kept silent about all of this as my parents were the ones paying the bills and during past meetings I would also just sit silently. In the short end,my parents talked about the money and spending habits asking what was my brother doing with that money. My brother got annoyed with similar questions and basically was responded with an attitude like these emojis 🙄😒

My parents would remind my brother that this was not just one incident.It got to a point where I was exhausted listening to my brother that he is spending money to help his career. My brother was telling my parents in a rude way  ""if i have to wait 10 years then ill wait 10 years, you guys will never understand.""

So I said to him ""What have you scraficed?"" And this is where I feel like an ahole,He started to get emotional and upset with me. He told me that I would never understand that what he have sacrificed that he studied at school from 6 to 9pm and stayed in his room all night for school,working, etc.

I was baffled and also got emotional and told him I'm a college student. I am going to go through the same thing, I have mental breakdowns, I am isolated and alone, I have no support system where my school is located, I'm working and burnt out, I'm studying 3-6 hours for each class, etc.

I argue that he has not scraficed enough to even start his career and it gets heated.


Context: My brother has recently graduated and he has been having issue with spending money throughout all 4 years. When he started to get credit cards, he maxed them out. My parents would tell him be better at spending or we will lock your card blah blah. (My father was helping to pay the credit card bills). It continuously went into this cycle of my brother spending more than his PT job and my parents ended up having to talk to him basically every 3 months.

I knew where this was heading.I learned this past 3 months,my brother's spending habits ended up almost totaling 5 grand. My parents kept asking me how do we teach your brother to be a little bit more responsible with money, how do we help him?

This is where shit kinda went loose.I usually kept silent about all of this as my parents were the ones paying the bills and during past meetings I would also just sit silently. In the short end,my parents talked about the money and spending habits asking what was my brother doing with that money. My brother got annoyed with similar questions and basically was responded with an attitude like these emojis 🙄😒

My parents would remind my brother that this was not just one incident.It got to a point where I was exhausted listening to my brother that he is spending money to help his career. My brother was telling my parents in a rude way  ""if i have to wait 10 years then ill wait 10 years, you guys will never understand.""

So I said to him ""What have you scraficed?"" And this is where I feel like an ahole,He started to get emotional and upset with me. He told me that I would never understand that what he have sacrificed that he studied at school from 6 to 9pm and stayed in his room all night for school,working, etc.

I was baffled and also got emotional and told him I'm a college student. I am going to go through the same thing, I have mental breakdowns, I am isolated and alone, I have no support system where my school is located, I'm working and burnt out, I'm studying 3-6 hours for each class, etc.

I told my brother that I am sick of everytime that I have come home this conversation happens every time.

My parents did not know any english so the whole application process is done by me and a math teacher. They were really unhappy about me leaving China but gave consent, and they paid for the school, which is 20000$ yearly and a boarding school, and told me I need to come back. There was one relative taking care of me there. Our family is pretty well off since my dad and mom is both graduates from the Beijing University, the best university in China. Their job roughly have 10000$ per month pay. However, I've gone to college at US and moved to Iceland, which was a very complicated process and took me 9 months. My parents was very unhappy about it, however, and asked me to come back

I told them that I will be staying in Iceland since it is a really good place, and that I am really sorry I cannot come back, and that I will help them(my parents only, specifically mentioned not my brother who bullied me) if they have issues, and things did not escalate that much.

Now my brother's wife had a baby and then she died from the birth, and my parents is asking me to come back to china since my brother is broke. I told them it could only be 3 months at most, since, even though my boss is VERY lenient, he still got a company to manage. They said it is a long term job. I politely declined, telling my parents that I am settled in Iceland and I will not be coming back too long. I told them that they can give financial aid to my brother, and that I could also give it. They declined to give financial aid for whatever reason, and I still gave 1000$. The parents then accused me of ""betraying"" china and the family, and all of my family except my uncle is shutting me out and accusing me of being selfish. They are saying I am richer than most of my family and I don't even have a wife and that I am selfish and a liar, which is true, so am I being selfish?

Caden is very obsessed with seeming masculine, and he takes a lot of pride in his personal style. He has a decent following on YouTube  and TikTok, and his “brand” is basically about being a player and attracting girls.

Well, he was making a video yesterday with some fairly expensive jeans he copped from a local custom designer. They are light pink and he was having trouble finding a shirt to match. He came out to the kitchen complaining, and I told him to wear this tee I got for his birthday last month. I told him the pattern had some pink in it and would match well with pink jeans.

Caden immediately started yelling and kicking off. He insisted that they weren’t pink, and accused me of gaslighting him. He said they were red and I just had an agenda of masculating him. These jeans are literally rose pink, so I was definitely not gaslighting him.

He called our mom at work (this was during her lunch hour) and told her what I said. My mom took Caden’s side and accused me of raining on my brothers parade by making him feel bad about his new clothes. I replied that I don’t think guys wearing pink is bad, and Caden is just making drama over nothing.

Now Caden won’t wear the jeans, and because they aren’t returnable, my mom wants me to reimburse him the cost of the jeans. There’s no way I’m doing that.

I didn't know why at the moment, all I knew is that my mom was pregnant with my little brother (18M). 

When I was 12, I overheard my dad talking with a friend of his and that's when I found out that my mother cheated on my dad and got pregnant with my little brother which is why they divorced (after paternity tests, my little brother was his but they still divorced, duh). Everything suddenly made sense, why my dad hated my mom so much, why everytime my mom and dad were around each other, my mom would look miserable and sad and my dad would look mad. I knew I couldn't tell my brother, he'd only blame himself so I kept the secret for years. 

Onto the problem: last week was my brother's 18th birthday and the family was over, we were having fun and both my parents were there. As I previously mentioned, they had their usual angry and miserable looks on their face and I guess my brother had enough. He snapped and asked my dad why he's always such a mean dick to our mom. My dad calmly told him that he's a mean dick to her because she's a cheating whore. That started a screaming argument between a few family members, my brother didn't believe it and my mom confirmed the reason they divorced. He looked at me asking if I knew and I confirmed that I did. He was so betrayed and he asked how could I keep this from him. I apologized and told him I found out on accident and that I didn't tell him because it doesn't matter, they're our parents and he's my brother. She didn't get knocked up by a random dude.

One of them was a 12-year-old boy who brought a doll-type thing which glowed and made noises if you pressed a button. We opened the present later after the party, and even though my son was happy to receive it, I noticed that the toy had a cracked shoulder.

The next day, when the boy came to play with my son and the other kids, I asked him who brought the gift, and he said he did it. I showed him the broken part and lightly scolded him. I simply told him that if he was going to spend money buying something, he should've checked the thing. I gave it back to him and told him to ask the store to replace it since it's broken. I thought it was a good life lesson and that he'd remember this. It would help him when he buys something later on. It would teach him not to waste his money.

However, later that evening his mom called me and told me that I was very rude to her son. She said and I quote ""if someone gives you a gift, you just appreciate it and don't say anything even if it's not that good, especially when it's a kid"" Turns out, he bought it with his own pocket money, and he put a lot of thought into it.

That is just taking it way, way too far.",28,0,171,171,"My boyfriend left home on his eighteenth birthday after a big fight with his dad. He tried to reach out after that, but his dad completely ignored him and wanted nothing to do with him. My boyfriend was really depressed about it, but he eventually got over it. I remember one night we all got drunk (we're apartment sharing with friends) and he told us that he was dead to his father, and that stuck with me.

Yesterday, he just showed up, my boyfriend's dad, that is. Myself and one of our roommates were the only people home. I answered the door, but I didn't let him in. He said he wanted to talk to his son and I said ""oh, your dead son?"" He must not have remembered or understood the reference, because he went completely pale and asked how/when he died. He looked almost as upset as my boyfriend had been, so I decided to let him stew in it.

I told him a fake story. He looked like he was going to throw up, and he asked if he could come in and have some water. I reluctantly let him, because he seemed very ill. Once inside, my roommate saw us and asked what was going on. My boyfriend's dad asked if he knew his son, and my roommate was super confused and it quickly came out that my boyfriend wasn't actually dead.

My boyfriend's dad was furious. He said I was a sick person with a hateful heart. I told him he said his son was dead to him, so why would he even care. He said he made a mistake in a moment of anger, but I made a cold-blooded decision. My roommate also said that what I did was fucked up.

I went to our room and called my boyfriend, who said to make sure his dad left before he came home, which I did, and he did, reluctantly.

Edit: One of you made a compelling case to tell my boyfriend as soon as possible about telling his dad he was dead. He wanted to know what his dad's reaction was and kept asking if he said anything other than asking for more information before he found out it was a lie. He only really asked questions like ""When?

She also has a dog that can't fly with her due to international restrictions, so he needs to stay with someone in the US. He is very loyal and doesn't really listen to anyone else but my mom. Also being a former stray, he's not the best with strangers.

The best option would be for him to stay with me. So, I asked my roommates if it was okay if I brought the dog to stay with us for two weeks. One of them clearly said yes. My other roommate (PY) wasn't as clear. She said that she had allergies and that she was also slightly scared of dogs so she didn't really want one to stay with us but said, if there isn't another option then it's ok. I took that as a maybe and told my mom as such, go look somewhere else and the dog should only come here if there are really no other options.

Fast forward to last night, my mom calls me saying there are really no other options and that the dog has to stay with me. I told my mom that my roommate's allergic and also scared but mom said to ask anyway. So I woke her up (she was asleep). I said ""I'm really sorry to put you in a hard spot but my dog has no where else to go, I know you aren't the most okay with that so is there anything I can do?"" PY wasn't giving me a straight answer when I asked that and more questions, I thought she was just tired. I offered to keep the dog downstairs and away from her. He wouldn't bother her as long as she ignored him and I would be doing all the care. After a bit of back and forth, she said ok, so I thanked her and apologized again then left to call my mom.

A family friend and her drove for a few hours to get to my dorm (I'm out of state) and got the dog all set up with supplies and food for the stay. Right before they're about to leave, the RA for our dorm shows up and says that the dog can't be left here as residential policy doesn't allow pets and that I'm making PY uncomfortable. I tried to explain that there aren't any options left and that PY said sure last night but the RA just said that there are no exceptions to the policy and that it was uncool of me to keep him here always but we could talk to the director. So the three of us went to see the director and right outside saw PY standing there. She was avoiding eye contact and quickly also left after the RA something to her.

I was pissed at her; I thought she was okay with it, but no she wasn’t and instead of coming to me she just went to the RA. My mom and her friend said that she was being rude and cowardly. I thought similarly but I also thought I might have missed something, forced her to say yes under stress, or something like that to make her feel that way to speak to somebody else. If that's the case, then I fucked up real bad.

If there needs to be more info, I’ll gladly elaborate.

UPDATE: Yea I think its clear that I'm TA here. Thank you everyone for your opinions, some of them hurt quite a bit but, that's to be expected when you post your dumbass-ry for the internet to judge. I'll apologize to her in the morning when she's awake. As for the 'her' post that's been floating around, I don't recognize the user but the situation is too uncanny. I'll try to ask her about it but, that's probably not a great idea. Again, thanks and I'm sorry for being so blind. ",66,"Unfair_Passenger8586","dj__dg",0

This is my stepfather and it’s their thing. I’ve always said how precious it is to me for them to have a bond and something just for the two of them, since they aren’t related by blood. He is the only one to call her monkey. He is a 60 YO loud over the top man who yes, does yell when he talks. But he has never yelled at my daughter in anger. It’s always being sweet. “Monkey eat your lunch” “monkey it’s time to take your hiney to bed”. 

This has been the routine since the DAY she was born.

Yesterday her father, sent a serious of texts to my parents (baby grand parents) asking him not to call her monkey anymore after it’s been the norm for 14 months. because of this new tik tok video he found which says she will subconsciously think she’s a monkey when she’s older. 

My parents find it ridiculous and told him so.  I call her stinky butt is she going to think she’s a bum subconsciously? This is not a new trend… to parent by whatever tik tok video he sees that day. 

My stepfather is extremely hurt. The text messages insinuated that it wasn’t appropriate to call her anything but her name and it needed to stop.

i should also add about 3 months ago a rift formed between stepdad and baby’s father. Unrelated circumstances but my stepdad just really doesn’t like him anymore. They’re encouraging me to separate… the whole shebang.

after they got those texts a phone call argument started …. 

personally, i think it would be different if it wasn’t almost a year and a half later, and instead was the DAY he started with monkey. like a simple i don’t love that nickname do you mind changing it?

I have been present in the kids lives for nearly all of their life, but still they think of me like step dad or even mom's boyfriend, I don't like kids that much either so I don't mind it and I don't want to be their father. We're confortable with the way things are. 

Anna does ice skating and she had a practice for a event that's gonna be help soon. Amy and I went to support her. Some other parents were there too. We were sitting and watching the girls skate.

When we got back home Amy asked to go upstairs to talk. She then told me it was kinda shitty what I did and that I could've just said ""yes"". I told her that anna is not really mine so I don't think I did anything bad. She's upset with me now, was I wrong here?

I(35M) was asked by my wife(34F) about the bonus I received at work this year. When I told her about what I got, she asked me if I could loan her $10k. Since she's never asked me for this before I asked what it was for. She said it was to ""help"" her brother buy a house, and she would give him the loan and she would pay me back in monthly installments in $1k. When I asked why she wouldn't just loan him directly, she said it was because she wanted some buffer in her own finances(we have a joint account for bills but don't really mix finances). I had a bunch of questions:

Is this a gift? No, he says he will pay me back.

How would we pay this to him? She would send him the money(He lives in another country).

When is he buying the house? He's just putting a down payment on the build. It's not built yet.

When is he planning on paying you back? He'll pay it back but no idea when.

Wife is adamant that she'll pay me back, and handle it if her brother decides not to pay back. I was really concerned that her brother might not pay her back and I told her as much. My big concern is that he'll pull a ""you're married to a rich American and so I don't have to pay you back"" line on her. There's no real recourse if he doesn't and I don't think that they're really that close. Plus he lives on the other side of the planet(China). I've had a lot of questions and concerns as I've been burned loaning friends/family money in the past and my wife finally just said she wasn't going to loan him money and that she now can't rely on me for financial aid anymore(we share bills, but I pay about 75% of everything as I make more) . I've offered alternatives but wife shut it down. Now she's mad and isn't really talking to me. She says that she doesn't want to talk about it anymore. AITA here?

I can probably swing this

I really like this guy and it's my first proper relationship as I have always been a bit too busy with work for a relationship but I really wanna put in the effort and enjoy myself and overcome my anxieties. Yesterday I told my sister(25F) that I plan on going with this guy to a restaurant that she has been wanting to try out and basically said ""Oh hey I can try it out with my date and then you and I can go together if it's good"" and that's when she got upset with me. She looked visibly hurt and I feel terrible. She asked if I even thought about bringing her too on this date so she can also get to know the guy and I told her I did but thought for a third date it might be too early for them to get to know each other. I also want to get to know this guy with it just being us alone. She hasn't really talked to me since that and is acting very cold toward me. I tried to ask her if she wants to be the one I take first and she blew up on me saying that I m in the wrong for not wanting it to be the three of us on this date cause she just wants to get to know him as well...so it seems like it's not about the restaurant and more of I didn't want to go with her and this has me confused.

I feel very conflicted because on one hand I want to be alone with my date and on the other hand I don't want my sister to be upset with me, she has also been having a difficult time at work so it's been difficult because I can't even really be excited around her about this new relationship, I noticed in the beginning when I do this I was getting one word answers or short answers from her so I dialed it down. I know it's not her fault that she is stressed and I obviously wouldn't want her to pretend to be in a great mood just cause I m in a new relationship, so I understand.

I have considered just folding and asking her if she will go with me but I also really don't want to so maybe I really am just being an asshole.

Am  I the asshole here for not wanting her to go with me?

EDIT - I feel a lot less conflicted about the situation now.

Not only did she never think to thank him, but she also tried banning him from going in the room at all when he occasionally needed to. One morning he knocked on the door to ask if he could go in to grab his sneakers and she said no and wouldn't even pass them to him. I had to intervene and get them myself. Despite this he was nothing but polite to her face. If I listed every passive aggressive thing she said/did to the boys during her stay it would make this post to long.

On Friday, the 13 yo and toddler were playing outside with a basketball. At one point 13 yo threw the ball a little too hard at his brother and knocked him over. My mom had been outside and saw what happened and started to berate the 13 yo and grabbing him hard by the arm. When his mom came outside to see why the baby was crying my mom continued to say foul things about my stepson and called him an awful brother and dangerous to her grandson. When stepson told his mom what he had accidentally done, my mom started raving about him doing it on purpose.

When I got home my stepson was sulking in his room. My wife had told me what had happened, so I went to see him, and we talked. He vented about how my mom had made him feel the whole week and asked me why she hated him and his brother. This made me angry and after talking with my wife, I decided to ask my mom to leave and told her she wouldn’t be welcome back until she corrected her attitude towards my stepsons. Of course, she didn’t take this well and after she argued with me for over an hour she left. Later I got a call from my dad who was livid, he wouldn’t let me explain myself, so I hang up.

I feel I did the right thing to protect my stepsons, but my siblings are also upset with me. They think I’m an ass for treating our mom badly and overreacting. Even my wife thinks we shouldn’t have kicked her out but instead talked to her and given her a chance to change her behaviour. AITA?",2077,"No-Names-Left-Here","AvailableField3322",0

I'm studying computer science and I'm currently doing an internship at a medium-sized company that hasn't laid off 30% of its employees (yet).

So, since I'm the one who knows about computers, my family sees me as their personal tech support. And my family is B.I.G. I live with my mom, my little brother, 2 of my aunts and their kids. The kids are lazy when it comes to tech shit because they know I'll do it for them, but my mom and aunts are beyond tech illiterate, they're tech morons.

I am constantly interrupted in my studies or word because my cousins forgot their Disney Plus profile pin, or my mom needs to reset her email password again, I actually set up a cloud password manager for them that they do not use because they always forget that it is an option. 

So a few weeks ago, one of my little cousins wanted me to help him reset a password after he got locked out of Google, and he aggressively knocked on my door demanding that I help him.  I asked him, ""Do I look like TS to you?"" and he said yes with a straight face.

So I got a domain and set up a help desk. Then I told my family that if they wanted any help from me, they should go to the website and submit a ticket for my help. My aunt said I was being ridiculous, but I was deadly serious.

In the following days, I would give them the cold shoulder if they tried to come to me with technical problems, and just tell them to submit a ticket and I would send them the solution by mail. Forgot your mail password? Too bad, use someone else's mail. Fortnite is lagging? Get a ticket and wait till I'm home. That helped me a lot.

But then yesterday I came back from the university and the whole house was sitting in the living room telling me to sit down. They were doing an INTERVENTION on me! WTF!? They said I was rude, cold, condescending, and unhelpful. My mom said she's tolerated my ""manly ways"" (no idea where that comes from) because I'm helpful with technology, but now they won't stand up to my disrespect and I'm treating them like children. I said no, I'm treating them like customers.

The discussion got heated and turned into a screaming match. I said I would move in with my ex-stepfather because he doesn't ask me to do shit, I'm still with my family but I feel like everyone hates me now, but my ex step father says I'm on my right to be annoyed by them.

Cut your aunts out and move on. NTA",2,0,2624,2624,"I (25F) recently lost my mother to cancer. Me and my brother (35M) are her only children. For the past 7 years, I’ve been staying in an apartment my mother bought. She always told me that when she died, she wanted me to have it because she worked so hard to ensure  I always had somewhere to live. So when she died, she left me the apartment in the will. My brother has no issue with this, he makes more than enough of his own money and actually owns an apartment in the same building. 

However, my aunts (A and B) have an issue with this. A has had money issues for as long as I’ve known her and my mother was always helping her out with money when she was alive. B is financially stable, but in no position to help A. They both think that since I make enough money to be able to rent a place, I should let A stay in the apartment and rent my own because that’s what my mother would have wanted. 

I said no, stating that my mother wanted me to have a place of my own. I am currently saving all the money I would have used on rent and intend to buy my own house when I have enough saved. 

When I said no, they then suggested that I should share some of the money my mother left me with them. She had two life insurance policies, both of which went only to my brother and I. She also left us the house and her car. Basically, everything was split between my brother and I and no one else got anything. My aunts feel that this was wrong and that they, especially A, deserve some of the money. 

My brother blocked them all on platforms when they asked this of him and suggests I do the same, but I feel guilty about cutting off my family. 

But I also feel strongly that if my mother wanted them to get money, she would have left them something. But she didn’t. She chose to leave EVERYTHING to my brother and I. My aunts are saying that my mother did that because she assumed we would share. But I knew my mother. She would have told me if she wanted me to do that. All she said was that she wanted to die knowing that me and my brother would be able to support ourselves.

The argument escalated but i don't remember much because i got so enraged that i started trembling and had to go home to calm myself down alone, as i left my fiancé there.

He lost his job a month ago and I have a business that I can't move. We have been discussing who will be the one to move and yesterday after weighing all options put my foot down and said that I can't be the one that moves because of my business. There isn't nearly as much for me to do with my business where he lives compared to where I live. It doesn't make sense to move and he can do his same job anywhere. 

Now to the family part. He and his family have always been close whereas my family wasn't always the best and we had a falling out for about a year and just regained contact about 9months ago and things are going good so far and I'm happy. My boyfriend however keeps saying that his family is better than mine and gets upset when I defend my family because he feels they don't deserve it. He said he worries about our future children being around them (I'm not even pregnant) and said they don't compare to his family. He has only met my patents once for a few hours and they were nothing but kind to him. I express to him that what he is saying is hurting me but he feels it needs to be discussed because one of us has to move and family is a factor and he's just being logical and then just keeps repeating everything that upset me right after I told him it upset me. I understand needing to talk about it but I feel there is a better way to talk about a sensitive topic than the harsh and abrasive way he is. 

He also devalued my business that I'm super successful in and wants me to just throw away 3.5years of hard work and attempt to rebuild it where he lives if I even can or just get another job because ""my job is not that difficult and I don't even need a degree for it and it's just a job."" My job isn't just a job to me.

To be brief; my husband is going to Miami with a friend for a long weekend. I think this is great and supported the idea of this trip since the beginning. 

We have a 17 year old daughter (his biological child, but I've been around since she was 5 years old. I love her to pieces.) He told me tonight that he informed our daughter 'Elisa ' that she could not leave the house nor stay overnight at any of her friends houses while he is on vacation. This was news to me as well (he mentioned this at dinner with all of us in the same room.)

Understandably upset, Elisa asked why and what had she done  to be punished. My husband said she had done nothing, but she needed to be home the entire time because that was the only way he could trust that I would stay home as well. He said he didn't trust me not to ""stay out and party all weekend"" unless Elisa was home and I had to take care of her. My party days are long behind me but he brings them up constantly, many many years after the fact.

Aside from the logic being incredibly flawed here, I'm frankly disturbed by the fact he will punish her and jam up her extended weekend as a tool to ensure I do what he wants me to do. 

I told him flat out I thought what he did was unfair to Elisa and a little sick. He's now telling me it's my fault he had to resort to this because he can't trust me.

Not only did she never think to thank him, but she also tried banning him from going in the room at all when he occasionally needed to. One morning he knocked on the door to ask if he could go in to grab his sneakers and she said no and wouldn't even pass them to him. I had to intervene and get them myself. Despite this he was nothing but polite to her face. If I listed every passive aggressive thing she said/did to the boys during her stay it would make this post to long.

On Friday, the 13 yo and toddler were playing outside with a basketball. At one point 13 yo threw the ball a little too hard at his brother and knocked him over. My mom had been outside and saw what happened and started to berate the 13 yo and grabbing him hard by the arm. When his mom came outside to see why the baby was crying my mom continued to say foul things about my stepson and called him an awful brother and dangerous to her grandson. When stepson told his mom what he had accidentally done, my mom started raving about him doing it on purpose.

When I got home my stepson was sulking in his room. My wife had told me what had happened, so I went to see him, and we talked. He vented about how my mom had made him feel the whole week and asked me why she hated him and his brother. This made me angry and after talking with my wife, I decided to ask my mom to leave and told her she wouldn’t be welcome back until she corrected her attitude towards my stepsons. Of course, she didn’t take this well and after she argued with me for over an hour she left. Later I got a call from my dad who was livid, he wouldn’t let me explain myself, so I hang up.

I feel I did the right thing to protect my stepsons, but my siblings are also upset with me. They think I’m an ass for treating our mom badly and overreacting. Even my wife thinks we shouldn’t have kicked her out but instead talked to her and given her a chance to change her behaviour. AITA?",2077,"FantasticPirate13","AvailableField3322",0

"After teen’s death, schools rethink sending children out of state to Diamond Ranch Academy","(Copied from previous posts on r/TroubledTeens )

Reddit can visit r/troubledteens to read more horrific testimonials and about families left broken by this (primarily) Mormon-run **Kids For Cash** machine that is Utah/Idaho/Washington/Oregon’s “Trouble Teen” industry. 

This whole grift is essentially just a legalized form of **Kids 4 Cash** and the center owners & therapists at these programs **own financial stakes in multiple lock-down treatment, outpatient, and wilderness programs.** They make a percentage of enrollment profits by filling and even over-filling these programs, even by placing teens in programs run by completely different therapists, well beyond their normal operating jurisdictions. They only care about a full-fill capacity and their bottom line, not who is in their program and what irreparable personal and intrafamilial damage it causes. There is no vetting process for enrollment and these Mormons genuinely believe every single person can benefit from their forced lifestyles- every teen sent is considered “acceptable.” No one is rejected, and the vast majority are not criminals and have no criminal history whatsoever— they’re just not 18 yet. They will, however, *both threaten* *and proceed* with trying to extend a captive’s minorship-status past 18 by legal means for those who do reach legal adulthood while held captive unwillingly. 

There is so much rampant physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and entirely unsympathetic to antagonistic to even sociopathic staff members who are **more than willing** to physically harm teens who simply say “I refuse” to an unreasonable command. Further, many programs even rent the kids out for labor purposes; it’s not uncommon to see them building trails or working on beautifying highways. 

Many centers (like Solstice Treatment Center) create fake reviews on Google- reposting the same text about “the program being great help” using multiple fake names that no one who was actually  in the program could recall. The r/TroubledTeens industry literally force-feeds enrollment lies and bullshit to families looking for genuine help. It is essentially a back-door form of false advertisement. Just like the entire r/troubledteens industry is a back-door Mormon-run Kids 4 Cash scheme.

A not insignificant portion of teens sent to these programs are queer or questioning youth from families that use these Mormons as a back-door form of conversion therapy. On top of that a not inconsiderable portion are there because their parents are truly pieces of shit and they’ve really been horribly abused; I’ve seen people sent to these programs for turning in their parents for committing crimes. I know someone who was sent to Utah because their mother found out they were testifying against them in court. Another person who filed a false police report under duress to cover for his abusive parents was abducted after telling the truth to school educators and the police.

Probably most significant is that a huge portion of teens sent to these programs **permanently cut contact** from their families afterwards, or, at the very least report the ability to trust and hold any sort of meaningful relationship with their parent/guardian is irreparable and never coming back. Compare this to the therapists and enrollment staff selling parents a bullshit flowery picture of “what could be” and you’ll start to realize how insidious and deranged this whole industry actually is.

Follow the cash- this is **MORMON KIDS FOR CASH** Entire townships are in on the grift.

Also- there was recently a case where a legally emancipated teen (abusive parents, namely the mother) was abducted by the therapy goon squad and taken to a lock-down center where he was held until pressure forced the center to relinquish his wrongful imprisonment/kidnapping. These Mormons do not give a fuck about who is sent to them, just that more keep coming.

Edit: To any parent reading this thinking of sending your kid to one of these programs, know there’s a very good chance they’re going to abandon you in adulthood, and **you will absolutely deserve it** for what you’re about to put them through.",100,0,3695,3695,NA,3695,"Piperplays","ninjascotsman",0

Parents should put the needs of their own children first, and it sounds like that's what you're doing.",3,0,1883,1883,"I (25F) have been married to my husband (29F) for a few years now. He has a younger brother who recently got engaged. I have known his brother’s girlfriend for 4 years. We’re not extremely close but we hang out whenever there’s a family get together.

Anyways, for her bridal party she’s asked me to be the Maid of Honour. She has four other bridesmaids composed of cousins and old school friends. I told her that I’m very grateful that she has asked me but unfortunately I don’t have the time to do all the things expected of a MOH. I just had my first baby in November and it’s a lot. She has expressed wanting a bridal shower, bachelorette party, etc.

I told her I can just be a regular bridesmaid. She seemed fine but afterwards, my husband told me that she was venting to my brother and telling him that I’m being cold to her. According to her, she thinks I’m lying by saying I’m too busy because I’m on maternity leave and that I have “all the time in the world” and all her other friends work full time. 

My husband agrees with me but his brother called me said I should try to “be accommodating to her”. I reconsidered and told her I would be her MOH if she covers half of the responsibilities, eg planning the bachelorette party. He said he would get back to me.

The next day, she calls me and asks me why I’m being so difficult. She says I’m the only one in the bridal party not working and that I should step up. I told her again that I’m on maternity leave taking care of a baby and it is actually even more demanding than full time work. She ended the call quite upset.

They told us not to worry about money because they covered the air bnb so all we would have to pay for is gas. It's a 19hr car drive. We arrived last Wednesday.

My in laws are so overbearing. Like if I go and take a shower, they are knocking on the door within 3 minutes to check on me. If I go to the bedroom to have a minute to myself, they are yelling up to me within 5 minutes to see if I'm good. If I say I need to go for a walk to clear my head, they follow me and make it a family thing. If I want to go site see they immediately get ready to go too and coerce us to go to the sites they think I will enjoy, versus what I would actually like. They sit there and talk to me and won't let me go to bed until after midnight and then they are up knocking on the door at 6am to get me and my fiance downstairs for coffee. And they literally do not stop talking from sun up to sun down.

I'm an introvert. I need space to refill my social bar and since I've been here, I haven't had a moment to myself. I mean not even being able to take a shower without being harassed is pissing me the fuck off. I've talked to my fiance about it several times and have told him more than once I need ""me time"". I need to stop being followed. I need to decompress. His way of combating this was to be up my ass 24/7 and continuously asking if I'm okay or to bitch to me about how annoyed he is becoming. Not helping at all. I've told him that. But after being followed when I was on the phone and having his mother try talking over the conversation I was having, it was the final straw. I packed my stuff and went to a hotel by myself. The $250 of my money to get home was now spent because I needed to get away before I lost it. My fiance knew I was beyond touched out and I warned him this was going to happen but apparently he didn't believe me. So now he's shocked that I would do this and make everything awkward for him and spend my portion of the trip money. AITA?

ETA: I mentioned to my in laws directly a few times that I needed space to decompress. Even when stating I needed to go on a walk to clear my head, they took it as an invitation to come along, despite me stating I needed space. Or like when I went to the bedroom, I announced it to the entire room that I needed a minute, and they proceeded to continuously yell up to me to make sure I was good. So they were fully aware that I was getting touched out but it seems like in their head that meant that they needed to helicopter and make sure I was okay by tagging along and watching me. We had plenty of money to get home. We set aside a specific set of money for the gas back.

Furthermore, I am at a highly prestigious university and I haven't really gotten along with the guys on my course. They are all very competitive and I just don't really enjoy their company - everything turns into a pissing contest, and they definitely take me less seriously because I'm a woman. I stopped interacting with them beyond the mere minimum and choose to hang out with other people. 

Anyway:

I did well in our recent exams (I topped two out of four exams we had so far). Our prof congratulated me during class (I wouldn't have advertised this myself). Ever since then, my interactions with a specific group of male classmates have gotten weird. They're now outright rude and challenge me aggressively in class discussions. We recently had some presentations and one of them chose to do theirs on, to put it simply, ""pretty privilege"" - they specifically pointed to two papers that suggested that pretty female students get overscored in assessments. The other guys in the group snickered and one even gave me a wink. Afterwards, I heard them in the hallway joking that ""they had experience with that themselves"".

I've been seeing a PhD student within our department for a month. He has literally nothing to do with our course. Well, we ran into one of my course mates A together. The next day in class his friend B asked me if ""my boyfriend"" helped me with exams. He said this intentionally loudly and in front of the professor, who heard this. I replied that I don't have a boyfriend (cause he's not my bf), but then B pointed out that he had run into me with the PhD student, making a point to say his name (the prof knows him). I just replied that we're only friends.

They didn't let up - I heard that they discussed this thing in two more classes, in earshot of the professors. Both times they suggested I got help for my exams ( I wasn't even seeing him then). I didn’t confront them, but this has been causing me so much anxiety - even without the exam accusations, I worked hard to get here and I don’t want to be known among the faculty for my dating life.

I raised this issue with my supervisor, without the intention of taking it any further, but I wanted her advice as a woman in academia. She convinced me to let her email their supervisors ""to remind them of proper conduct"" and described their treatment of an ""unnamed female student"". She didn't name me, but they figured it out. They confronted me after class and asked my why I would report their “silly joke“. Apparently, their supervisors are now very cold towards them and less interested in helping. It’s not a formal complaint - only their supervisors know - but one of them, C, said his supervisor writes the reports for his financial aid/scholarship and it was my fault if he lost out on that.

I now feel a bit embarrassed and this was compounded by a friend telling me I took it to far cause C shouldn't lose out on his scholarship. So, reddit - AITA?

And I can imagine mom would be even more pissed if you left the paints behind and Ella decided to decorate the loveseat and carpet.",6,0,6923,6923,"So my (31F) best friend “Riley” (31F) recently just got a part-time job after several years of staying home with her daughter “Ella” (6F). She and her husband “Joe” (34M) haven’t been able to get the childcare situation totally sorted out and needed a babysitter last Saturday, so I agreed to watch Ella for the day while Riley was at work. 

I've been sort of the ""cool aunt"" ever since Ella was born. I typically will bring small gifts or activities whenever I know that I will be seeing her, which isn't all that often. Ella is a smart and engaged kid and I like to give her things that will interest her and keep her occupied.

One important piece of information here is that I'm a very crafty person. I have a small online store and also work with local businesses for selling and distributing small batches of my product - hand painted wooden figurines. I thought it might be fun to introduce Ella into my hobby/business, so I ended up bringing 10 unpainted figurines to choose from, a few tubes of acrylic paint, and some paint brushes. 

We immediately got to work and Ella was *so* into it. She had an absolute blast painting her turtle figurine. But when it came time for me to leave, I started packing up all of my supplies and Ella became visibly upset. Riley insisted that I leave the supplies behind so that Ella could keep and play with them. I disagreed, and basically said that I have no obligation to give away any of my belongings. 

I personally feel like I was more than generous by babysitting Ella on my day off (I do have a regular 9-5 job as well) and providing a fun activity for her. Riley pointed out that I have a pretty large stock of items at home, which is true, but still - letting Ella keep the supplies and figurines would've been a loss in profit for my business. Ella cried when I didn't let her keep any of the stuff and Riley argued that I should have never brought “toys” over if I wasn't willing to let Ella keep them. 

Now Riley hasn't been responding to any of my messages or calls and I can only assume she's still angry over this whole thing. I thought I was doing something nice by babysitting and providing a fun activity.

YTA, for a few reasons 

The neighbour was lurking in the shadows as stated by your dad waiting for his dog to get a lock on, but your dad didn’t intervene, he watched?

If you aren’t a licensed breeder, why isn’t your dog de-sexed to avoid this happening?

Why don’t you have fences?

If you’re planning on selling the puppies for a profit, no reason why the neighbour can’t have one as you’re gaining from his dog essentially 

Our dogs have ‘human food’ eg rice, meat, eggs and veg, it’s not always irresponsible 

It doesn’t sound, from having an unfenced yard and fertile bitch, that you should keep 5 ‘adorable’ puppies that you can’t in turn desex- unless you’re fine with prolific inbreeding

So many dodgy factors here, YTA",0,0,1391,1391,"PS: I am 15 and I live in the Philippines

One day, while I was away, my grandfather let my dog out in the backyard for a few minutes. He didn’t notice that my neighbor’s dog was also there. Somehow, he managed to get close to my dog and mate with her without anyone noticing, this wouldn't usually happen as my dog would usually bark away other dogs and coincidentally according to my father, he saw my neighbor's outside just deliberately waiting for his dog to get a lock on my dog and did not stop his dog.

A few weeks ago, she gave birth to five beautiful puppies. They are all healthy and adorable. They look like a mix of both parents.

However, as soon as my neighbor found out about the puppies, he came over and demanded that I give him one of them. He said that since his dog was the father, he had the right to claim one of them as his own.

I refused to give him any of the puppies because:

A. He never asked me for permission or consent before letting his dog mate with mine.
B. He never took any responsibility or care for his dog or mine during or after the pregnancy.
C. He doesn’t have a proper environment or lifestyle for raising a puppy.
D. He feeds his dog human food which is bad for their health.

I don’t know what to do now. I don’t want to give up any of the puppies because:

A. They are part of my family now and I love them all equally.
B. They are bonded with their mother and siblings and separating them would be traumatic for them.
C. They are still too young to be weaned or separated from their mother (they are only 4 weeks old).
D. He leaves his dog outside all day without shelter or attention.

Am i the asshole for wanting to keep them?

Edit: I want to thank everyone for taking the time to comment and educate me for the effects of keeping them together, i might also have been probably the YTA for my own selfishness of keeping them for their ""own"" good, but learning upon the effects of keeping them together and as others pointed out, me being 15 and not being able to afford to neuter/spay them, i will be having them entrusted some* trusted relatives of mine believing they will have a good home once mama dog shows signs of not wanting to have anything with them anymore.",1391,"Haunting-Juice983","FranzMCPE",0

"AITA for forcing my younger sister to sell our family home after our mom died","Info: once the house sells do you plan to continue to see your sister?",2,0,849,849,"So. My mother died last Wednesday. She wrote on the will that the house belongs to Sister1 and if she sells it, 90% of the proceeds go to Sister1 and 10% go to me. Problem.

There's a third child, an estranged sister. Lets call her Sister2. And my mother did not get the will witnessed or notarized which in Florida is needed to uphold a will.

Sister1 has been living in this house for about 10 years now. But every lawyer we've talked to has said that it doesn't matter the house will be split three ways by a judge. 

Sister1 wants to keep the house, even though she can't afford the mortgage. And technically she can't even keep it since it belongs to all 3 of us. She's saying I'm an asshole because I'm not giving up my third of the house to her like our mom wanted. AND for not helping her pay the mortgage she can't afford. She's refusing to start any of the process needed to put the house under the three siblings names and sell it. So we can try to sell it.

If we don't sell it, and she misses any of the mortgage payments the house could be lost and then no one gets anything. I offered to help with the mortgage for 6 months to hopefully sell the house in that time. But she's still saying I'm not doing enough to help her keep the house and should be helping for longer while she continues to drag her feet and prolonged having to split the house three ways.

Next week I'm going to go above her and start the process myself since technically any of the three of us can do it. She hasn't even told Sister2 that she has a claim to the house. She's been trying to find loopholes to cut her off since she was estranged from us. But sorry. Legally she has a right to a third of the house. She also wants us to buy her out, but I don't have that kind of money and I have no problem with the house being split.

I dont understand why I should be expected to give up my legal right to a third, and help her pay the mortgage.

EDIT: Seems like a 30/70 in favor of being the asshole. I'll say this, both Sister1 and I have helped our mom financially and medically. When I came back and it looked like it was turning bad. I had already assumed my mom had left the house to Sister1. And while I get the emotional part of this, every lawyer Sister1 and I have talked to say that Sister2 is getting a third. I refuse to have Sister2 take a third, while Sister1 takes her third and mine while I get nothing. But thanks for the comments and takes

EDIT2: Ppl keep asking about the 90% and 10%. Sister1 is 30, but she lived at home for 10 years with no real bills. She did this straight out of college not because our mom needed any type of care. She only paid $150 in rent for those 10 years, and wasn't even working full time. I do understand why my mom would have wanted her to have the largest share since from her POV Sister1 has no income or honestly anything else. And sister2 getting nothing also make sense as her fallout with our mom was very big. But both Sister1 and I helped with mom's bills and medical care when needed. I even paid for my mom's life insurance for about 2 years. 

It's really Sister1's denial that unless I help with the mortgage she's losing the house that's getting me. Sister2 is getting her third whether we like it or not. Sister1 is not going to be able to keep the house. Her dragging her feet is going to cost me money, not from the house, but because I'm going to have to pay for this mortgage to make sure we dont lose the house before its sold. And even if I do that, Im expected to give up my third?",849,"Jax_Cat11","heynoweevee",0

The only problem is that it costs $5,000, which is way more than she had budgeted for.

While I'm happy to support my friend on her wedding day, I just can't justify spending that much money on a dress that she'll only wear once. I've already spent a lot of money on the bachelorette party, bridal shower, and other wedding-related expenses, and I'm not sure I can afford to add another $1,000 to the tab.

My friend is a little bit of a bridezilla, and she's been very focused on having the ""perfect"" wedding.

I know she misses having a glass every once in a while. She’s been especially strong when I had my buddies over to watch sports and we had a few beers. Also she loves her coffee and I couldn’t tell you how she went to work for 8 months without it. So I felt bad and splurged.

Last year, when i graduated high school, I thought that at least the day of my graduation would be all about me. I know it is selfish but throughout high school I had some serious mental health issues so to make it to graduation and graduate with high honors, I wanted to celebrate ME. I had this big idea in my head that my family would all be there to support me and we would have lots and lots of photos and it would be a happy day but it was not. My mom invited her friend that I barely knew to my graduation because in my mom's words ""she watched me grow up she deserves to be there"".

During the ceremony, my dad texted me after my name was called and I walked across the stage to say that he was going outside now because he saw me and told him not to because the ceremony wasn't over and I didn't want him to miss anything. That already made me feel bad but I tried to just let it go because it wasn't that serious. Then afterward I expected to get photos with my family and then my friends because I wanted to celebrate this moment with my friends because WE FINALLY GRADUATED. So I leave the building to look for my family and I finally found my mom and the people she came with. She had my uncle, step dad, her friend, her friend's granddaughter and my grandma. I wanted to get photos with all of them but after one photo my mom said that she was done and wanted to go home and it made me feel bad.

My 2 sisters had wore heels and they were complaining that their feet were hurting and that they were ready to go. At this point I had yet to get photos with my friends, so i told them that they would have to wait. They complained to my dad and he got aggravated and said that were leaving and come on. I left sad but tried to get more photos with my dad and sisters but in all the photos my dad was on the phone and my sisters had sour looks on their faces so I just gave up that night. I was so upset and I cried to my dad and sisters in the car but they couldn't care less about anything I was saying. I decided that after that day I didn't want them at this graduation.

I F30 have history with groom, we had the same friendship group in early teens and twenty. This friendship group imploded, when I had to take my ex to court for a number of reasons reddit will not allow me to post. (I won in court, he was charged and have restraining order).

During this time I suffered from ptsd and anorexia, it took a long time to rebuild my life. Some of the group took his side and were not happy I was taking it to court. F1 would repeatedly harass me blocking my car in, threatening me and turn up where I was, including my house at all hours of the night. In the end I had to tell her, I would also take her to court if she did not back off. She backed off. 

The wedding is this year I was asked to be bridesmaid and happily accepted. 6 months later I see a post that my sister has asked F1 to be a bridesmaid. I feel disrespected and that I do not feel comfortable with this person. Please note the bridal party was meant to get ready at my house and there's no way F1 is setting foot in my house. I don't want to be bridesmaid but my parents say I should keep the peace. I will still go to the wedding and support my sister, but want nothing to do with f1. I am not asking my sister to choose, just that I want to back out as bridesmaid. So WIBTA for breaking the peace?

"WIBTA for asking my wife's friend to buy us a replacement board game?","NTA, but at the same time, it’s good practice to never loan out anything you’re not prepared to lose.",4,0,9,9,"So my wife loaned her friend our copy of ""Draftasaurus"", a tabletop game in which you draw various wooden dinosaur pieces out of a bag and deploy them in different places for different points. I had honestly forgotten about the loan, but recently my wife let me know that the friend had disclosed that she lost several pieces, and her stated plan was to 3D print them in order to replace them.

This is a game in which you need all the pieces to play (but only when there's a certain number of players). Moreover, the pieces are made of wood, so anything 3D printed would have a different feel to them, which might be relevant in a game where you're meant to draw them out of a bag.

We're both skeptical the 3D printing plan will ever happen; the friend is not particularly tech-savvy and would need to use a local library or something. 

Even so, my wife does not want me to say anything; she is almost pathologically averse to conflict. I, on the other hand, would like to bring this up to the friend to spark some kind of fair resolution, and would do so as non-confrontationally as possible, but my wife doesn't believe that's possible. 

The friend also does plenty of favours for her professionally, just as we do favours for her personally, including babysitting her kid (who was the one who lost the pieces, presumably). My wife does admit that the friend is very well off financially and could certainly afford to buy a replacement copy rather than this 3D printing scheme.",9,"nriabko","BixxBender123",0

"AITA for telling my family to mind their own business?","NTA

I'm sorry for you loss.  Your entire family are being complete AHs here.  While it is indeed normal for **some** people to remarry quickly, it completely depends on the person.  And, **you are not ready** to even consider dating.  And that's OK.  You know your own grief and feelings better than they do.

In times past, when people mainly married for a role (i.e. ""father/mother of the kids""), their view made sense.  Because it was a role, the person could easily and quickly be replaced as they really didn't matter outside of that role.  Sort of like how, if a barista quits, the business will hire another one.  

Honestly, given how much they pressure and harass you, I'd go LC or NC with all of them until **YOU** are ready to date.",1,0,1175,1175,"Six years ago I lost my husband. We were childhood sweethearts who married while in college and had two children together. His death was sudden and unexpected and came through as the result of an undiagnosed heart condition. I have not had an interest in dating since my husband. Or to remarry. This is not what normally happens in our family. My grandpa died when my dad was a baby and my grandma remarried within a year, an aunt lost her husband and remarried within two years and an uncle was the same. A couple of months ago my cousin remarried 18 months after his wife died. This is seen as the best way, the only way, to move forward healthily, especially when you have minor children who need ""a second parent"".

I disagree. And I have not engaged beyond my initial, I will decide if and when I want to date again. But the last four months have been worse. They attempted to find me a man. Brought random men to meet me during family gatherings and thought we'd hit it off. It didn't happen. They told me my kids had lost out on the important years of having a father present and I had done them a disservice by allowing them to reach an age where rejecting of a new parent is 10x more likely. I told them I had not once thought of replacing their dad for them and was not setting out in life just to find them a new dad. They told me that's not what our family members did before me, but what they did was make sure they were never missing that second parental figure. Then tried to tell me I could give them another mom if I didn't want another husband. But it's not healthy to stay single.

I told them to mind their own business and leave it alone because I don't want to hear it every time I see or speak to them. They said I was being rude and unreasonable and clearly didn't want to listen, so I left with my kids. They said I was taking their concern and throwing it back in their faces which wasn't fair of me.

You can find more info here: https://www.knowyourix.org/",303,0,29168,29168,"Background: I'm (F23) one of only a few female students in a male-dominated course. Furthermore, I am at a highly prestigious university and I haven't really gotten along with the guys on my course. They are all very competitive and I just don't really enjoy their company - everything turns into a pissing contest, and they definitely take me less seriously because I'm a woman. I stopped interacting with them beyond the mere minimum and choose to hang out with other people. 

Anyway:

I did well in our recent exams (I topped two out of four exams we had so far). Our prof congratulated me during class (I wouldn't have advertised this myself). Ever since then, my interactions with a specific group of male classmates have gotten weird. They're now outright rude and challenge me aggressively in class discussions. We recently had some presentations and one of them chose to do theirs on, to put it simply, ""pretty privilege"" - they specifically pointed to two papers that suggested that pretty female students get overscored in assessments. The other guys in the group snickered and one even gave me a wink. Afterwards, I heard them in the hallway joking that ""they had experience with that themselves"".

I've been seeing a PhD student within our department for a month. He has literally nothing to do with our course. Well, we ran into one of my course mates A together. The next day in class his friend B asked me if ""my boyfriend"" helped me with exams. He said this intentionally loudly and in front of the professor, who heard this. I replied that I don't have a boyfriend (cause he's not my bf), but then B pointed out that he had run into me with the PhD student, making a point to say his name (the prof knows him). I just replied that we're only friends.

They didn't let up - I heard that they discussed this thing in two more classes, in earshot of the professors. Both times they suggested I got help for my exams ( I wasn't even seeing him then). I didn’t confront them, but this has been causing me so much anxiety - even without the exam accusations, I worked hard to get here and I don’t want to be known among the faculty for my dating life.

I raised this issue with my supervisor, without the intention of taking it any further, but I wanted her advice as a woman in academia. She convinced me to let her email their supervisors ""to remind them of proper conduct"" and described their treatment of an ""unnamed female student"". She didn't name me, but they figured it out. They confronted me after class and asked my why I would report their “silly joke“. Apparently, their supervisors are now very cold towards them and less interested in helping. It’s not a formal complaint - only their supervisors know - but one of them, C, said his supervisor writes the reports for his financial aid/scholarship and it was my fault if he lost out on that.

I now feel a bit embarrassed and this was compounded by a friend telling me I took it to far cause C shouldn't lose out on his scholarship. So, reddit - AITA?

This person then wrote me a message saying that I'm an asshole for violating her personal integrity by pointing out where her nearest service office is located. (Which is an hour away from her btw)  


She feels violated that a strange man on the internet ""googled her name"" and learned information about her.   


Considering that where a person lives in my country is public information and can be looked up by anyone who has an internet connection I don't think I violated her integrity by ""googling her"" and indirectly sharing which municipality she lives in. She also implied malice by writing ""you knowingly wrote it"". 

&#x200B;

I suggested if she was worried about her personal integrity she shouldn't share her full name on facebook and pointed out that anyone can find out where she lives, and that if it this caused her distress she could prevent it from happening in the future.  


I'm struggling a bit to understand how exactly I'm violating someone's integrity by ""googling"" them and finding out public information in order to share the business hours of a government agency. If someone wants to know where she lives they can find out in 15 seconds regardless of me saying which municipality she lives in. If I had shared something that wasn't public knowledge it would've of course been different.

Lily is a bully. I have met her a handful of times and she is always making fun of Eni, who is a little fat, Lily's always telling that bad pig jokes and she even gave Eni a nickname, Pigni.
I have complained to Tom and Tom's mom that Lily's jokes weren't funny and she should stop, but they always said she was just joking. I told Eni that she should return the jokes to Lily, but she can never think of anything to say.
Last year I was invited to Tom's family's Christmas party, everything was fine until Lily said something like ""Oh God Eni, you've already eaten so much, at this pace you'll stop being Pigni to become Whalni"" and she laugh with the children at the party. I was furious and Eni and Tom gave a fake laugh and said that Eni was 4 months pregnant. When we were all congratulating them, Lily said ""wow, at least now you can excuse yourself when people see you eating like a pig."" I got furious again but Eni asked me to just let it go but I know how much that jokes hurt her. So I went back to having a talk with Tom and his mother about why Lily's teasing had to stop.
 Well, this weekend was Eni's babyshower, we were having a good time until Lily told another joke about how ""fat"" Eni had gotten, I had enough so I laughed so loud to attract attention and said ""Oh Lily, you're so funny, especially when you finish your jokes with that ugly pig laugh, sometimes I think people laugh more at your laugh than at your joke."" Lily got super serious and she told me it wasn't funny, to which I said ""come on, it's a joke"" and imitated her laugh, the kids at the party laughed too and Lily ran away while she cried. Tom's mother scolded me for the joke and I asked her why Lily's jokes were funny but mine weren't, if they both had a pig joke in it, and her mother couldn't answer me. I told her that every time I heard Lily tell a joke about Eni, I would return the joke. Eni told me that I shouldn't have done that, but I could see her hold back her laughter along with the other guests, but I'm tired of Eni being walked over. They have told me that since I am older than Lily I should behave better.

They told us not to worry about money because they covered the air bnb so all we would have to pay for is gas. It's a 19hr car drive. We arrived last Wednesday.

My in laws are so overbearing. Like if I go and take a shower, they are knocking on the door within 3 minutes to check on me. If I go to the bedroom to have a minute to myself, they are yelling up to me within 5 minutes to see if I'm good. If I say I need to go for a walk to clear my head, they follow me and make it a family thing. If I want to go site see they immediately get ready to go too and coerce us to go to the sites they think I will enjoy, versus what I would actually like. They sit there and talk to me and won't let me go to bed until after midnight and then they are up knocking on the door at 6am to get me and my fiance downstairs for coffee. And they literally do not stop talking from sun up to sun down.

I'm an introvert. I need space to refill my social bar and since I've been here, I haven't had a moment to myself. I mean not even being able to take a shower without being harassed is pissing me the fuck off. I've talked to my fiance about it several times and have told him more than once I need ""me time"". I need to stop being followed. I need to decompress. His way of combating this was to be up my ass 24/7 and continuously asking if I'm okay or to bitch to me about how annoyed he is becoming. Not helping at all. I've told him that. But after being followed when I was on the phone and having his mother try talking over the conversation I was having, it was the final straw. I packed my stuff and went to a hotel by myself. The $250 of my money to get home was now spent because I needed to get away before I lost it. My fiance knew I was beyond touched out and I warned him this was going to happen but apparently he didn't believe me. So now he's shocked that I would do this and make everything awkward for him and spend my portion of the trip money. AITA?

So they were fully aware that I was getting touched out but it seems like in their head that meant that they needed to helicopter and make sure I was okay by tagging along and watching me.

If they complain about ruining the surprise, just tell them your husband knows you hate surprises and you love him for respecting your feelings.",2,0,167,167,"I recently found out that my group of friends is planning a surprise birthday party for me. Now before everyone starts getting at me for being ungrateful, hear me out. In the past, my friends have thrown me a few surprise events. When I got married, my bridesmaids insisted on throwing me a surprise bridal shower and bachelorette even though I insisted that I hate surprises. I’m ok not knowing details, but I wanted to at least know the gist of what was going on. I was kept in the dark until the day of, and I was thrown a tea party - something that wouldn’t even be on the top 50 things I would like to do. I felt horrible because I genuinely didn’t enjoy it, but couldn’t say anything because I knew how expensive the venue was. I was grateful that they planned it, so I thanked them and just reminded them that I’m not a huge fan of surprises. Another time, they threw me a surprise picnic birthday party, because they know I love picnics. They didn’t realize that the reason I love them is that I love cooking and packing the food beforehand - so I didn’t get to be a part of what makes me love picnics because it was a surprise. Again, I told them I’d like to not have surprises anymore. Fast forward to this year, I caught on that they were trying to plan a surprise party through my husband. Again, they chose something I really would rather not do, at least for my birthday. I had to get my husband to lead the conversation to avoid that activity, and suggest something I actually want to do. But from a bowling/arcade joint, they went ahead and reserved only the arcade without asking which I would like. And instead of splitting the birthday person’s expenses equally like we do every birthday (It would have only been $3 more per person), they pressured my husband into paying my whole share. I’m grateful that they’re going out of their way to spend their time and money on me, but I really don’t understand why they keep trying to surprise me with things without even trying to find out what I want to do. It honestly feels like everyone is wasting their time and money. I’m also the only one they ever try to surprise - everyone else gets asked what they want to do.

AITA for feeling this way?

ETA: A lot of people are saying my husband should have put his foot down, but he’s honestly not that close with my friends and didn’t want to cause a scene. He said more than he normally would have even in his own group of friends. In a perfect world, he would have done a lot of what the comments are saying, but he went above and beyond out of his comfort zone to steer the conversation at least to the venue I would enjoy.

ETA 2: To the people asking why I didn’t just plan my own party, I simply didn’t want to go out of my way to celebrate my birthday this year. The one thing I wanted was an upscale dinner that my husband already planned as a date. One of my friends asked me how I wanted to celebrate, and I told her that I don’t need to do anything for it this year. They decided after this that they would throw me a surprise.

And now, even though I  have my doorbell installed she still does it. I did not teach her how to do any of this. She just decided to help me out lol.  

I brought a friend over for the first time recently. This is the first time she's met Nala as well. The first thing she comments on is how I named her Nala, because  apparently everyone and their grandma names their golden Nala. Lion King was my favorite movie growing up, sue me. 

Then I showed her a video of Nala pawing at the door because it got a bit awkward after that comment. It's usually a great ice breaker. She laughed and thought it was cute. I showed her another one. She asked me why Nala was doing that and I explained. 

She doesn't say anything for a minute and then goes ""So, she's basically your servant? Is she just here to get the door?"" 

I was thoroughly done with her judgmental ass by that point and I just asked her to leave. She left, but she did message me afterwards saying I was rude as fuck kicking her out after she travelled all the way to see me, and that how else was she supposed to think of my dog with videos like that?",6330,"the_white_slave","day6fan",0

I (21F) recently got into a scuffle with my coworker Bri (20F) fake name of course. Bri and I were like two peas in a pod but recently that changed. Bri had sent me a long paragraph about everything I was doing wrong at work and to me feels like she was saying that I should get fired. And I agree that text can be misinterpreted and I may have misunderstood what she was trying to say. I was just really pissed off that someone that I consider a close friend of mine would send me that. But everyone is saying that she was coming to me as a friend because I hearing that I was getting fired but turned out to be false. But after her sending me the text it rubbed me the wrong way I didn’t feel comfortable at work anymore. Then the next week she sent me another text apologizing and saying that we should talk one on one or with a manager. I picked the manager one so nothing can be misconstrued but I felt like it was going so fast and I never really had the time to process everything. Then we had the meeting a couple days later and I felt like an idiot because I didn’t have anything to say. I felt like a deer in headlights because it felt like they wanted me say something but I honestly couldn’t and nothing was resolved. Then I had a long conversation with my coworker and she was telling me that should take the time to process everything then have a conversation one on one with Bri. Which takes us to now I feel like I probably took too long and now she doesn’t want to be friends with me anymore. And I know that this may sound childish but do love and respect her and I’m starting to see where she was coming from. Because she’s always been a great friend and I never had to question our friendship but lately I feel like I’m in a pickle and I feel like it’s too late. I feel like if I had seen the text as a friend coming to a friend but I just jumped the gun early.

"AITA forgiving away my ten years old daughter's dog as a punishment?","YTA

Your child's 10 years old, you can't expect her to take care of the dog as if she were an adult.

What's wrong with you that you'd misjudge a 10 year old's sense of responsibility like that? What cartoon world are you living in that you thought that she'd be taking care of the dog and all you'd have to do would be take it to the vet occasionally, buy it food and a trainer?

Your daughter is 10 years old.

10 year old children are known to have fleeting attention spans. 10 year olds are also known to not have the wherewithal to know that owning a dog is more than just cuddling with a live teddy bear when the mood suits you.

Do you know that your daughter is 10 years old and that she's not an adult yet? She hasn't even reached puberty for crying out loud.",1,0,896,896,"(i made a mistake in the title, sorry, it should be ""for giving away"")

My daughter (10) wanted a puppy for her birthday so my wife and I went to a shelter and picked a puppy for her, we made it very clear that she had to be responsible for it. That means that she'll have to clean after him, feed him and checking his water bowl, etc. We would hire a trainer and would take him to the vet when it was needed, but besides that she had to take care of it. 

During the first month things were okay, she did as she promised. But now (over two months since she got the puppy) she complains about having to clean when the dog poops or pees on the floor and when she had to take care of him. This week she reached the last straw because she forgot to give him water, my wife had to fill his bowl because she didn't do it. 

I told her this is enough because a dog is not a toy and she promised to be responsible. I contacted some friends/ family and asked them if they wanted the puppy. Finally a coworker said she wanted it and I took him to her house. 

My daughter is very sad now but I think she needs to learn a lesson here. My parents told me I was being unfair because deep down I knew that my daughter was gonna fail in being responsible and I set her up for failure. They think that as a dad I need to teach them but not punish them the first time they make a mistake. Are they right? I think that that's a good advice if it was something else, but a dog is a living animal and it deserves someone who truly cares for it.",896,"palegate","No-Possibility6020",0

YTHugeA",1,0,510,510,"Recently, we had a birthday party for my (32f) son (7m) He invited some of his classmates and our neighbour's kids who he's close with. One of them was a 12-year-old boy who brought a doll-type thing which glowed and made noises if you pressed a button. We opened the present later after the party, and even though my son was happy to receive it, I noticed that the toy had a cracked shoulder.

The next day, when the boy came to play with my son and the other kids, I asked him who brought the gift, and he said he did it. I showed him the broken part and lightly scolded him. I simply told him that if he was going to spend money buying something, he should've checked the thing. I gave it back to him and told him to ask the store to replace it since it's broken. I thought it was a good life lesson and that he'd remember this. It would help him when he buys something later on. It would teach him not to waste his money.

However, later that evening his mom called me and told me that I was very rude to her son. She said and I quote ""if someone gives you a gift, you just appreciate it and don't say anything even if it's not that good, especially when it's a kid"" Turns out, he bought it with his own pocket money, and he put a lot of thought into it. He did replace the gift, but he has stopped coming to play with my son. AITA? I genuinely didn't mean to upset him. I didn't even really scold him.

"AITA for not sharing my “toys” with my best friend’s daughter?","NTA

You let her have the one she painted, which is fair. Then trying to take all of the figurines and supplies makes them the AH. (Mostly the mom though)",1,0,6923,6923,"So my (31F) best friend “Riley” (31F) recently just got a part-time job after several years of staying home with her daughter “Ella” (6F). She and her husband “Joe” (34M) haven’t been able to get the childcare situation totally sorted out and needed a babysitter last Saturday, so I agreed to watch Ella for the day while Riley was at work. 

I've been sort of the ""cool aunt"" ever since Ella was born. I typically will bring small gifts or activities whenever I know that I will be seeing her, which isn't all that often. Ella is a smart and engaged kid and I like to give her things that will interest her and keep her occupied.

One important piece of information here is that I'm a very crafty person. I have a small online store and also work with local businesses for selling and distributing small batches of my product - hand painted wooden figurines. I thought it might be fun to introduce Ella into my hobby/business, so I ended up bringing 10 unpainted figurines to choose from, a few tubes of acrylic paint, and some paint brushes. 

We immediately got to work and Ella was *so* into it. She had an absolute blast painting her turtle figurine. But when it came time for me to leave, I started packing up all of my supplies and Ella became visibly upset. Riley insisted that I leave the supplies behind so that Ella could keep and play with them. I disagreed, and basically said that I have no obligation to give away any of my belongings. 

I personally feel like I was more than generous by babysitting Ella on my day off (I do have a regular 9-5 job as well) and providing a fun activity for her. Riley pointed out that I have a pretty large stock of items at home, which is true, but still - letting Ella keep the supplies and figurines would've been a loss in profit for my business. Ella cried when I didn't let her keep any of the stuff and Riley argued that I should have never brought “toys” over if I wasn't willing to let Ella keep them. 

Now Riley hasn't been responding to any of my messages or calls and I can only assume she's still angry over this whole thing. I thought I was doing something nice by babysitting and providing a fun activity. 

AITA for not letting Ella keep my crafting supplies?

They let their dogs roam free and they have stolen things and torn up things around my house. To say I don’t like my neighbors is an understatement. 

The past week I’ve had an uncollared dog pay me visits during the day and night. I gave him food and I shit you not he ate and entire big bowl of food in about 2 minutes(that’s no exaggeration). He is so skinny you can see his hip bones, tips of his vertebrae, and all his ribs. The way he acts is textbook abuse. Last night he came for food and I could hear someone yelling outside. When I wen out on my porch Doc Brown (I named the stray dog that) was gone and the yelling was coming from my neighbor. This morning I woke up and walked out to my car when I could hear Doc whining from across the pasture. It made my heart ache. I looked through a rifle scope I have and saw that they keep him in just a 6x6 kennel with no bed, house or bowls of water and food. He was up against the fence facing my direction just yelping. So I decided when I get home today and he escapes again I’m going to bring him inside and shelter him till I can take him to my farm and let him live there with all the shelter, water and food he could ever want. 

The only thing is I know it’s wrong to take someone else’s dog but these people are mistreating him so badly and I can’t stand it. There are no animal shelters just a local humane society run by some older people and that it’s. No cop here is gunna care about a dog so I feel I need to step up and help Doc out. 

WIBTA here?

Edit 1. A lot of people have told me to call the local PD. People from very rural areas know that local cops are pretty much useless in a situation like this. They know everyone and my neighbors will know I called. What makes me nervous about them knowing it’s me is my two rescued hound dogs. They could shoot them and claim ignorance or do something to them. Local cops are as useless as tits on a boar hog. 

Edit 2. People that are commenting who are from city outskirts or the city themselves. In a area that has only 400 people living here there is no pound or animal control. If there is dead animals on the side of the road or in the road they stay there till buzzards eat them or maggots do. There is a local humane society but it’s two people that run it and I’ve already called and they can’t do anything since it’s an owned dog.

My guess is half the time he will forget to buy something 🤷‍♀️",1,0,2486,2486,"
I (50f) been in a relationship with my husband (52m) for several years, we've been married a year and there have been many gift-giving situations throughout. I’ve always been the one to make things happen - someone wants something I figure out how to get it done. I've always been involved in the gift selection process for his children who are both in their mid/late-20s (1m, 1f). On my side of the family we've never done the step- words...and as it pertains to them it's always been **the** kids or **our** kids. I've used it in this title in case you feel it is pertinent. 

So here is my issue...in each of these instances I do not get a thank you, I barely get a vague acknowledgment. I did get an awkward ""um uh um thanks I guess"" on one birthday. Gift-giving has been mostly initiated/pre-planned by me. I usually enjoy it.  I know it's not that the gifts have not been good gifts. I have overheard on more than one occasion one or both of them bragging about what their dad got them and how he's really stepped up his gift-giving game these days. It's hurtful. There's a lot of real estate between a hearty pat on the back and the disrespect I feel. Something in the middle would be nice.  I pay attention throughout the year to what they state their current interests are, an item they drool over, causes they like to support, etc. and what I would give for just a look-me-in-the-eye thank you sometimes. 

Most recently, 1 had a baby showers and there were multiple tables FULL of gifts from 55 different people...54 of them got a 'thank you'. Guess who didn't. The slight was so obvious that another woman turned around, laughed and said ""they didn't say it so I will...thank you!"" Yeah, not funny but I'll play it off, ""it's all good haha pregnancy brain."" 

I get excited about gift-giving and how much they'll love something and I just end up feeling lousy afterwards. Honestly, now that I'm typing this out I realize that they know proper etiquette it really is that they just don't think it applies to me for some reason. 

So AITA for telling their dad that I will NEVER disapprove of any money he wants us to spend on anything he wants to give to his children, I'm just no longer comfortable putting myself in that position when there is so little (or no) appreciation? I will try to thicken my skin over this and am hopeful that eventually I will resume my current level of active participation, but for now it’s ok to step back, right?",2486,"marley_1756","secondhandparent",0
"AITA for not wanting to invite my friend to my birthday party?","Totally NTA. It sounds like your friend has some kind of jealousy towards you and is trying to do her best to be the “better” version of you. It’s totally inappropriate for her to wear a princess dress; maybe a formal one, but not a princess dress",-1,0,10,10,"Backgorund story: I, female 16, have a Friend, who is also female 16. Usually we are really close. A few months ago I noticed a few changes in her behaviour: She started to make mean comments sometimes. Something about me having a resting bitch face and judging everyone. And tbh it hurts a bit. I got bullied as a little kid and now I try to be nice to everyone and just please everyone. I just want people to like me and hearing that I am not good in it hurts me. But I never thought much off it. I am just trying my best. Since she makes those comments just sometimes, I am not mad at her. 

Also I noticed changes in her style and personality: Usually she is a emo gamer girl, the nerdy kind. But suddenly she started dressing and acting more girly like I do. She always wear black clothes and I wear like pastel colors. Normally she has dark red hair but now she wanted to change to my old hair color (mind you I had bright, colorfull hair color)

To the main story: In a few months I will turn 17. As mentioned before, I got bullied as a kid and never had any friends. So I didn’t celebrate my birthday. Nowadays I have a few friends and I can celebrate with them, so my birthday is a really big thing for me. This year I wanted to have a princess birthday party like I always wanted to as a kid. I told my friend about it, because I was so excited and she started getting excited too. I told her I would get a princess dress to really feel the vibe.

A few days ago she showed me a few dresses, she wanted to buy and wear for my birthday. Mind you, that there is no dresscode and everybody can come in there normal clothes. The dresses she wants to buy are princess dresses (yk those short dresses with the poofy skirts which were all over tiktok). All those dresses are baby blue (which she never wears, but I do)and hella expensive. They cost round about 80euros, which is a lot for a dress you buy for your friends birthday.I told her that there is no need to buy a dress for my birthday but she insisted, saying ,,she wants to wear a colorful poofy dress and that she wants to feel pretty""

Tbh it makes me feel mad and I guess insecure, because I feel like she is trying to make my birthday about her. Also I feel she is jealous about me and tries to copy me, because of all those little changes into things I like and those mean comments. Now I don’t want to invite her to my birthday because she makes me feel bad.

The question is now: Am I the insecure asshole who makes a fuss about nohing or could she be jealous?
And would I be the asshole if I didn’t invite her to my birthday?",10,"cuttingtriangles","Alone_Anonym",0

Heather has a nephew Kai who is 8. Kai's parents are going through a divorce right now and his mom is already seriously dating this guy who moved in with them. Kai is hating the whole thing. I'm not close to Heather or her family but was dragged along for a family party at her parents house Saturday (I'm 17 and still split time between my parents and was given no choice by my dad). Kai was upset and was talking about how much it sucked. I told him I got it. He said everyone in his family was telling him he should be happy because he wouldn't have to listen to his parents fight anymore and he should be happy they're divorcing. Kai said he wasn't. I told him neither was I. That I knew nobody with divorced parents who wanted them to be divorced or were happy about it. I told him most of my friends have divorced parents and all of them wish it hadn't happened. Heather and her sister overheard what I said to Kai and I got into so much trouble for saying it. They said it was unfair to make him think being unhappy with the divorce is okay and I shouldn't be saying that when I grew my family because of the divorce.

I do find this funny because Heather and her kids (her little demons as I call them in my head) were no great family addition. Most of the time I have to make sure none of my stuff has been broken or stolen and to never ever buy snacks for myself with my money because that stuff will be gone. I also get to hear about them getting suspended from school every time I'm at my dad's.

Now before everyone starts getting at me for being ungrateful, hear me out. In the past, my friends have thrown me a few surprise events. When I got married, my bridesmaids insisted on throwing me a surprise bridal shower and bachelorette even though I insisted that I hate surprises. I’m ok not knowing details, but I wanted to at least know the gist of what was going on. I was kept in the dark until the day of, and I was thrown a tea party - something that wouldn’t even be on the top 50 things I would like to do. I felt horrible because I genuinely didn’t enjoy it, but couldn’t say anything because I knew how expensive the venue was. I was grateful that they planned it, so I thanked them and just reminded them that I’m not a huge fan of surprises. Another time, they threw me a surprise picnic birthday party, because they know I love picnics. They didn’t realize that the reason I love them is that I love cooking and packing the food beforehand - so I didn’t get to be a part of what makes me love picnics because it was a surprise. Again, I told them I’d like to not have surprises anymore. Fast forward to this year, I caught on that they were trying to plan a surprise party through my husband. Again, they chose something I really would rather not do, at least for my birthday. I had to get my husband to lead the conversation to avoid that activity, and suggest something I actually want to do. But from a bowling/arcade joint, they went ahead and reserved only the arcade without asking which I would like. And instead of splitting the birthday person’s expenses equally like we do every birthday (It would have only been $3 more per person), they pressured my husband into paying my whole share. I’m grateful that they’re going out of their way to spend their time and money on me, but I really don’t understand why they keep trying to surprise me with things without even trying to find out what I want to do. It honestly feels like everyone is wasting their time and money. I’m also the only one they ever try to surprise - everyone else gets asked what they want to do.

AITA for feeling this way?

ETA: A lot of people are saying my husband should have put his foot down, but he’s honestly not that close with my friends and didn’t want to cause a scene. He said more than he normally would have even in his own group of friends. In a perfect world, he would have done a lot of what the comments are saying, but he went above and beyond out of his comfort zone to steer the conversation at least to the venue I would enjoy.

ETA 2: To the people asking why I didn’t just plan my own party, I simply didn’t want to go out of my way to celebrate my birthday this year. The one thing I wanted was an upscale dinner that my husband already planned as a date. One of my friends asked me how I wanted to celebrate, and I told her that I don’t need to do anything for it this year. They decided after this that they would throw me a surprise. The activities that he and I suggested were simply things that I’ve been wanting to do if we were to get a large group together.",167,"delsevdn","lehiu",0

So, by taking you away from a ""usually safe place"" i mean taking actions that you do regularly on a game and turning them into enemy encounters or something along the lines of that.

And i don't mean just jumpscares or ambushes (Like for example in The Last Of Us, you open lots of doors and sometimes opening a door triggers a staged scene or something like that, but i dont consider that as a ""safe place""), i mean things like crafting benches or save stations (also safe zones, but i cant think of any example of this), two examples are TLOU 2 and Dead Space 1, on TLOU 2, i was recently shown by a friend that if you start crafting at a certain crafting bench, you [get ambushed](https://youtu.be/i4ez9uGGRq4?t=70), and in Dead Space 1 (2008), a very similar thing happens, only that an enemy [falls behind you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlOo1OtaLwA&ab_channel=Walkthrough%21Database) and its more of a jumpscare (with the music and all), so yeah, anyone know the name of this ""concept""? i just love it when they do stuff like this in games, it keeps the gameplay fresh and makes you keep an eye out the whole time, does anyone else agree with me or do you guys not really care for this kind of stuff?

PS: While looking for the Dead Space clip, i came across a [Dead Space Remake clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFhbqvxFNdA&ab_channel=Trathiel) which does something similar to both the clips i showed here but without any enemy interaction, just pure suspense, even the first comment says something along the lines of what im saying, ""... you feel so vulnerable in such a small area that you're so used to as a safe haven""",0,"HolyMolyitsMichael","PastelLicuado",0
"AITA for telling my sister she was wrong for telling our parents WHY she doesn't want kids?","honestly… i dont see the issue with her saying shes too lazy and selfish for kids. thats the exact way i say it when people ask why i dont want children.

I don't have any specific reason for not wanting children, I just lack the desire and I strongly believe that the question should be ""why do you want kids?"" instead of ""why don't you want kids?"".

My older sister, Sadie, was very vocal about wanting to have children in her early 20s, but now that she is in her late 20s, she changed her mind.

Our parents never liked that I don't want kids, but they didn't care much about it either, since they knew Sadie will give them grandchildren. But now that Sadie changed her mind, they are panicking.

They invited us both over to dinner, then ""confronted"" us on why we don't want to have children and demanded a reason. I told them I just simply lack the desire and I expected Sadie to do the same, but instead, she threw me under the bus.

She decided to perpetuate the childfree stereotype and said that she is too lazy and selfish to have children. She doesn't want to start her mornings with making breakfast, getting the kids ready and taking them to school, she is just too lazy for that and doesn't want to give up her nice vacations and hobbies.
 
Thanks to her, now our parents are bugging me too and believe I'm a selfish, lazy person. I told Sadie she was wrong for telling our parents that's her reason and she should've thought about me before opening her mouth.

Sadie said she has every right to tell our parents whatever she wants and it's not her fault they are the way they are and that I can't stand up for myself. AITA?

Edit: She called herself lazy and selfish and that's what I have a problem with.

Edit 2: Again: nobody has to give a reason why they don't want kids, so no, there is no such thing as an invalid reason. I don't care what Sadie's reason is, my problem is that she used the words LAZY and SELFISH, which are the absolute worst childfree stereotypes.",1623,"astrology-wh0re","Life-Description-787",0

You, your sister and your mother might find it a lot easier to support one another through this shared trauma than getting angry at each other over birthday cards.",6,0,1,1,"So my sister (29F), mother (65F) and I live together and every single birthday, something happens where my father’s parents bring a card over. And every single time my mother asks about it in a weird way - which causes my sister to go up to her room, upset that my mother said it weirdly, on her birthday. My mother does do it on MY birthday too but I don’t take any notice of it. 

My father abused my mother sometimes and cheated on her(?), but it’s a sore subject for my sister as he contacts her and she doesn’t like to talk about it. Growing up, my mother and father were constantly arguing. My sister always says that they’re the reason we’re so fucked up & that I shouldn’t have been put through that as I was a child when they started to fight. My mother was a very angry woman, and my father was always focused on work and sports. But tbh looking back on it he seemed depressed. Idk there’s a lot of things that happened and the proof of the big accusations nobody really has. Except for the abusing part - as my mum has some photos. Anyways, my father doesn’t contact me but his parents, who we’re not fussed on, always puts a birthday card through our door.

Well, it happened again as it’s my sisters birthday and I told my mother, who noticed the card through the door, to NOT say anything. She said she wouldn’t. 

I went upstairs and came back down to my mother asking my sister who the card (that she hid from my mother even though I told her that mum had already seen it) was off and if they gave her anything.

My sister bluntly said: “Grandparents, they gave me money” and huffed and went upstairs. I went into the living room and my mother was eating a sandwich, she looked at me with wide eyes and I whispered angrily “Why’d you go and bloody say that for after I told you not to?!” and she said that there was nothing wrong with asking.

I proceeded to go up to my room to collect myself, and then after I heard my sister go and into the shower, I went back downstairs and angrily questioned my mother. I said stuff like “you told me you wouldn’t do it”, “you’ve upset her on her birthday, this was supposed to be a nice day for her” and she’s gotten all shaky and replied to me with “I’m not a child.” and “I know I ruin every day!” And trying to make me feel bad. She always denies that’s she’s in the wrong. She knows that my sister gets upset whenever it’s brought up. 

Now I’m stuck in a house with an upset, stubborn mother, and an upset, fed up sister on her birthday. I’m stuck in the middle again and I feel sick. I feel bad for going off at my mother, but she shouldn’t have said anything to my sister about them when she said she wouldn’t. 

I keep getting involved in their arguments and it’s stressing me out. AITA?

Clearly she was wrong but I was a kid and adapted. My father started legal proceedings against my mother and the whole thing took 6 years.

I would visit my father for half of summer vacation and many holidays. But I really loved my life with my mom.

When I was 14, my father basically threatened to have my mother arrested if she didn't let him have custody of me.

So against my own wishes, I was forced to move back to my dad's home full time.

I hated it here and I essentially lived a separate life from my dad and his family.

When I was 16, my grandad died and had left his company to his two sons (my dad and uncle) and me. We all got a third ownership. 

My dad and uncle had more kids but my grandfather never updated the will. My family says it's because he got too old to remember. 

So here is where I think I'm the asshole. Since I was 16, I didn't know any better and my dad and uncle just ran the company themselves.

But when I turned 18, my dad and uncle talked to me about splitting the company 50/50 between them so they could split it fairly among all the grandkids instead.

I would get a cash payout of $300k for my share.

But I talked to a lawyer on my own and refused to agree. In addition, I asked for my share of the profits since the past two years and that I'd be part of the business going forward while I was going to college.

This has made life extremely difficult for my dad. My uncle is extremely resentful that only one grandchild gets a huge stake. And my dad is now paying me my share of the profits for the past two years out of his own pocket just to keep the peace.

AITA? Maybe if I was on better terms with my father, I'd be open to their plan.

NTA and i didn't know Nala was from the lion king so i feel dumb now",1,0,6330,6330,"I F27 recently moved into my new house. I have a golden retriever named Nala and she is the sweetest. 

I'm Deaf, too. That bit is important. When I moved in, I had a bit of trouble having flashing light doorbells put in and there was a while I had to go without. My friends and family know to give me a call when they drop by instead of ringing the doorbell but unfortunately I have missed many a package this way. 

For some reason, Nala caught onto this. At one point she began letting me know when someone was at the door. She'd do this in multiple ways. If I was in the living room where I can see the front door,  she'd go and paw at the door, or if I was upstairs she'd come and gently headbutt me  to let me know someone's there. It took me a while to catch on to what she was trying to do, though. 

And now, even though I  have my doorbell installed she still does it. I did not teach her how to do any of this. She just decided to help me out lol.  

I brought a friend over for the first time recently. This is the first time she's met Nala as well. The first thing she comments on is how I named her Nala, because  apparently everyone and their grandma names their golden Nala. Lion King was my favorite movie growing up, sue me. 

Then I showed her a video of Nala pawing at the door because it got a bit awkward after that comment. It's usually a great ice breaker. She laughed and thought it was cute. I showed her another one. She asked me why Nala was doing that and I explained. 

She doesn't say anything for a minute and then goes ""So, she's basically your servant? Is she just here to get the door?"" 

I was thoroughly done with her judgmental ass by that point and I just asked her to leave. She left, but she did message me afterwards saying I was rude as fuck kicking her out after she travelled all the way to see me, and that how else was she supposed to think of my dog with videos like that?",6330,"Cyarsonix","day6fan",0
"AITA For telling my MIL not to meddle with my and my fiancé's sex life?","Please run as fast as you can away from this man, his controlling mother and this relationship. You're still so young, please don't throw away another moment on this guy. NTA",1,0,1135,1135,"Me (19F) and my soon-to-be husband (21M) got engaged after 4 years together.

I was really young when we first started dating and the nagging of my MIL, wanting us to have kids early, always bothered me. I took my complaints to my fiancé but he dismissed me saying that i should ""understand his mother's ways"". I didn't get her hopes up about me having kids, because i always said that i wanted to mature enough to be able to raise a kid.

As i said, i just dismissed her nagging, until last week.

My fiancé came home from work (that btw he works with his mother), saying: ""I was with mom all that in the office,and after she told me some things i came to the conclusion that you should stop taking your birth control pills"". Unbelievable. Didn't even want to argue about something this ridiculous.

Time passed and we didn't touch this issue anymore.

The weekend came, and we went to visit my MIL's house, she took me to her room saying she needed to have a word with me and my fiancé.

She sat down on the bed and said: ""I had a discussion with Luiz (my fiancé's name), and i told him about my concern with you guys not having children at the appropriate age. Who knows if you're going to be able to have children with this disease of yours? As for now, he will no longer allow you to buy the birth control pills per my request""

(He never buyed them for me, i work 9 hours a day and everything i buy for myself comes from my money)

About ""my disease"": It's a disease that all the women in my father's side had: Uterus Cancer. My great-great-grandmother passed due to it, my great-grandmother too and my grandma had it after giving birth to my father, but the doctors took the uterus out before the cancer could spread further. My grandma was always cautious with me. Never had any issues, and i go to the gynecologist 2 times a year to do exams.

 I got enraged, and looked at my fiancé who was sitting beside her, and he just averted his eyes.

""you will regret leaving the thoughts of having kids after your graduation, because god time is now and i got a revelation from the pastor that one of my family members is going to try to have kids and it's not gonna be able to. I'm sure that person is you, and i'm worried for my son. I can't leave this marriage be if your thoughts don't align.""

When she said that last line, i exploded, saying ""Are you so desperate for me to sit on your son's cock and have a baby so what? It's not your business if we're having kids or not or if we're having sex or not, this must be a joke"".

The argument escalated but i don't remember much because i got so enraged that i started trembling and had to go home to calm myself down alone, as i left my fiancé there.

When he came home, he was pissed off saying that i disrespected his mother and that if i didn't apologise he would consider breaking off the engagement. Honestly am not making any effort to set things straight as i'm very offended by everything she said.

This is obviously a special event that Sophie is putting a lot of work into planning. It's disrespectful to her for you to look like you're running out to the grocery store instead of a special celebration. 

Take some pride in your appearance. It's not a big deal to put on some mascara, lip gloss, and decent shoes. Lot's of people juggle family, work, and school commitments while managing to dress appropriately for events. Stop being self-centered.",3,0,11,11,"I (30f) am in my final semester of graduate school (so the pressure is on). But it’s also my brother’s bday this weekend. His gf (I’ll call her Sophie) is really sweet and has planned a celebration for him: First, a chauffeur (Uber?) is driving the 6 of us (her, my brother, mom, dad, me, and my bf) to a shopping center about 2 miles from our house for drinks at a trendy bar, then dinner next door at a restaurant/brewery. Sophie is paying for ALL of this; I offered to pay for myself, my bf, and my mom but she kept insisting. I managed to get her to accept *some* help from me. 

This morning, my mom asked me what I’ll be wearing that night. “No idea” I said, “probably something like what I’m wearing now: jeans, a bodysuit, a nice sweater, my tennis shoes- I’ll do my hair but I won’t put on make up.” My mom acted really surprised at this. 

“Oh no, you can’t go like that! Sophie is going through all this trouble for making this *experience* for us. You need to put in some effort.” I was taken aback by how cross she sounded- as if I had said I was going to wear my pajamas to dinner. I explained to her that my mind is on other things, that I don’t feel like taking more than 20-30 mins to get ready, and that where we are going isn’t considered very fancy (it’s kinda pricey, but def not fancy- people are often in shorts + sandals there). She got mad, saying it wasn’t fair to Sophie (Sophie knows I’m in the middle of finals).  

My mom insisted that I not wear tennis shoes and that I put on at least a little make up- I said no bc I almost never wear make up (maybe 4-8 times a year). She then got even *more* annoyed with me and essentially said the only reason I’m “being difficult” about this is because I dislike my brother. I told her that although I am not looking forward to the dinner, I want to be comfortable and I will wear what I like. She tried pulling the “do it for me” card but I stood firm. I told her what I’m wearing is perfectly appropriate for where we are going. This really made her mad because she then dismissed me from the convo and I left the house, fuming. 

Later, she tried to guilt trip me by saying things like “well this may not be a big deal to someone like you who gets to go out all the time” (I don’t) “but I never get to do things like this so it’s a big deal to me” and I answered “okay, so then YOU dress up- why are you trying to dictate what I’m going to wear?” She’s still pissed at me. 

I feel like she escalated this for no good reason- I get that she wants to make a good impression for Sophie but I can’t see why my outfit choice would somehow ruin the “experience”? WIBTA if I go dressed the way I want to?

Info: 

-Dinner plates at the restaurant range from $18 for a burger -$56 for a steak.

This is because I am ginger, my husband is blonde but our baby came out with dark hair. He freaked out in the delivery room and his behavior got him kicked out the hospital. I had to beg him to do a paternity test and he finally agreed after a month, and it proved that I didn't cheat. We had been together since we were 13 so I was devastated and all I wanted was him back, but I've come to my senses and decided that someone who believes that school level punnet squares are the be all and end all of biological inheritance is not the type of person I wanna be with. I was also treated like crap by everyone but my older brother, Alex, while we were waiting for the results because they all thought I had cheated. It was a horrible experience and as a result, I've lost many friends and family members. 

Since the results came back, my ex has been begging me to get back with him. I moved in with Alex after we split, and he comes almost everyday to beg me to get back with him. My in laws have also been harassing me too, especially my MIL who has come over four times in the past week asking me to forgive her son and to 'let God back into my heart'. I used to be a Christian and so are all my in laws and my family, but how I was treated when my baby was born made me lose faith fast. The whole church community treated me like trash during this whole ordeal and it made me want nothing to do with them anymore and I don't want to raise my son in that sort of community.

Yesterday, my MIL turned up to Alex's when he wasn't here, and she had the pastor from the church I used to attend with them. They practically forced their way in, and I was being berated like a child for not forgiving my ex's 'lapse in judgement'. The pastor basically sat there and said I would be going to hell if I didn't take my ex back. I excused myself to use the bathroom, and called the police. Pastor and MIL were escorted out. 

Now, I'm being harassed on social media and being called and texted by literally everyone that knows both me and my ex and his family. They're calling me the AH for going nuclear and calling the police on two people who weren't being threatening and they're demanding that I apologise immediately.

This is a purely subjective rule. Just because you find something IAF does not mean it belongs here. It's impossible to define what *is* IAF, but for a general idea browse the [top posts of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/top/?t=all) from this subreddit. It's easier to define what *isn't* IAF, here are most of the things that are NOT IAF.

___

###The content of a post (image/gif/video/article) and title must be interesting and interchangeable. The title must describe the content of the post. A post which has the content of a portrait of Albert Einstein with the title listing all of his accomplishments is not interesting as fuck, the content must show those accomplishments. The content of the post must show/depict what the title says.

**Things that aren't IAF**

* mildly interesting things, kinda interesting things, interesting things

* Social media screenshots, or screenshots in general. 

* No unnecessary sound

* Memes, funny things, edgy content

* Things that are purely cute

* Things that are NSFW

* Click bait, ""Top 10 best X""

* Just because something is old does not inherently make it IAF.

* Hold your phone a certain way to see an image, or shake your head to see an image, or light mod/dark mode pictures



*Note: Breaking this rule usually just means your post gets removed. (extreme violations, as in you have no idea what belongs here will get you perma banned)*

####**Titles Must be descriptive**

Titles should describe the content of the post. If you're going to claim facts/interesting as fuck stuff in the title the image/gif/video/article/content should show that claim in some way. Titles like ""Wow, this is awesome"", ""top 10 best posts EVER"" will get you banned. This isn't a click bait subreddit. Titles that ""piggy back"" off of other posts, like ""Since we're posting Mcdonalds...."" will also get you banned. You also shouldn't include where you're cross posting it from, just throw a source link in the comments. 

We don't need unnecessary information in the title, just describe what you're posting.

*Note: Breaking this rule will get you a temp ban in most cases (combined with other broken rules, or multiple offenses will mean a longer temp ban or permanent ban).*

####**If needed provide a source**

If you can't completely explain why the content of the post is IAF please comment with more explanation. If your post claims something that most everyone can't easily confirm from reading your title and viewing your content please provide some type of proof of what you claim. Do not claim ownership or creation of something you did not create. Do not post false or misleading information

*Note: Breaking this rules will get you perma banned in most cases. *

####No text on images/gifs/videos

In most cases text on an image is useless. It can be put into the title or into the comment section. Text on gifs is sometimes useful, but still preferred to put information into the title and/or into the comment section. This also encourages discussion. There are some exceptions to this rule, mainly dates or little labeling on images/gifs/videos. Youtube videos are not allowed

It's perfectly fine to disagree with anyone about most things, but there is no need to insult the person. Debate/discussion/talk about the idea/content, not the person. If someone is arguging in bad faith, concern trolling, baiting, general trolling, or just being a rude individual REPORT THEM, DO NOT ENGAGE with them.

"AITA for lightly scolding a 12-year-old because the birthday gift he gave to my son was broken?","YTA and gross",1,0,510,510,"Recently, we had a birthday party for my (32f) son (7m) He invited some of his classmates and our neighbour's kids who he's close with. One of them was a 12-year-old boy who brought a doll-type thing which glowed and made noises if you pressed a button. We opened the present later after the party, and even though my son was happy to receive it, I noticed that the toy had a cracked shoulder.

The next day, when the boy came to play with my son and the other kids, I asked him who brought the gift, and he said he did it. I showed him the broken part and lightly scolded him. I simply told him that if he was going to spend money buying something, he should've checked the thing. I gave it back to him and told him to ask the store to replace it since it's broken. I thought it was a good life lesson and that he'd remember this. It would help him when he buys something later on. It would teach him not to waste his money.

However, later that evening his mom called me and told me that I was very rude to her son. She said and I quote ""if someone gives you a gift, you just appreciate it and don't say anything even if it's not that good, especially when it's a kid"" Turns out, he bought it with his own pocket money, and he put a lot of thought into it.

When talking about my financial aid, my mom was constantly talking about how she was gonna take it from my account (we had a shared account at the time as I had just turned 18 a couple months before this) and how she would send me money every week or basically as she saw fit. I was uncomfortable with this as she has made my sister take out loans to pay for their Disney vacation and use her aid to buy her new sewing machine to which my dad had to pay her back both times. I tried to say something at first but she quickly shut it down. After talking to my sister and dad, they advised me to make my own account for the money to go to. I felt bad but didn’t want to say anything to my mom as it would make her mad and I didn’t want to be made to switch it back. She kept talking about it and I said nothing about my plan (keep in mind not saying anything was advised by my sister and dad). But Rhee and my dad were planning a trip to the mountains and the closer the time came for them to book the place, mom talked more and more about my aid and asking me if it had came in yet. The day it came in I had gone to work with my dad so I planned on telling her that night to which my dad agreed with. An hour after she got to work she called me saying she had called the people in the financial aid department and they told her the money had been sent out already.

"AITA for expecting my boyfriends parents to treat my daughter the same as his daughters?","Your daughter doesn’t _deserve_ anything from Martin’s parents. She’s your daughter and while it’s sad that her father isn’t involved and that she doesn’t have grandparents to spoil her it’s not anyone else’s responsibility. Especially when you and Martin aren’t married or living together. Furthermore, she has been treated incredibly well by his parents. An embroidered blanket sounds extremely thoughtful. 

If you aren’t careful all your pushing and entitled behavior is going to kibosh this relationship. 

YTA",18,0,9765,9765,"I (37F) have been dating Martin (39) for what will be 2 years this June. I have a daughter, Scarlett (10) and he has 2 daughters: Miley (13) and Joanna (12). I am a single mother to Scarlett. Her father sends me maintenance each month but has never been an active parent and has never met Scarlett. I also grew up in care so I have no family or anything. Whereas Martin is divorced and shares custody with his ex-wife. Their custody agreement is very flexible with the girls sometimes staying with him or their mum longer or often spending times with both parents together. It really bothered me a lot that he was still good friends with his ex-wife and Martin said if I couldn’t handle the fact he could coparent well and be amicable with his ex then he would end things. I like to think I got over my jealousy and that the girls mother and I get on. 

Anyway since we’ve been dating a while and have started discussing potentially living together I think it’s only really fair that Scarlett is more involved and treated the same as Martin’s daughters by his parents. She met them for the first time a few months ago and has since seen them a few times since but she’s treated virtually like a stranger. At Christmas, Miley and Joanna were spoilt rotten. They got money, gifts, toys, gift vouchers and makeup. All they got Scarlett was an embroidered blanket thing Martin’s mother spent weeks knitting apparently with her name on it, two gift vouchers and a doll.

They’ll take Martin’s girls for overnight sleepovers but my kid is excluded. They say because they don’t know her that well and are uncomfortable looking after her for now. They’ll buy Joanna and Miley sweets or little trinkets and give them a couple of pounds here and there every so often but as for Scarlett, they might only give her one thing and that’s it. It’s not fair for Scarlett.

The last straw was when his parents asked if we would all like to go to Disneyland Paris in Easter with them. They offered to pay for Martin, the girls and said that they could pay for part of mine and Scarlett’s travel expenses, but that I’d have to pay the rest.  

I lost it and told Martin he needs to tell his parents to treat Scarlett like his girls are treated. It’s not fair to her that she has to watch her sisters being spoilt and she isn’t. He lashed out in return and said my parents have been nothing but accommodating to Scarlett by including her in things and getting her stuff at Christmas and so on. He said I’m incredibly selfish to expect his parents to treat my daughter who they barley know as the same as their grandchildren. He said that I’m bitter and jealous and it’s not like we’re married or living together. He used the example of the blanket being a really sweet gift that shows how much his mother cares. He also said it’s perfectly reasonable for his parents to expect me to pay for my own child to go to Disney and that my parents don’t need to pay anything at all for us. He also said I’m raising my daughter to not learn the value of the word no and that she can just be expected to get whatever he wants. He also said that Joanna and Miley are not Scarlett’s sisters, it’s never been emphasised they were and they do not view Scarlett as that. He said that I need to ‘get your arse in gear and realise nothing is being done to discriminate against or exclude Scarlett.’

AITA?

ETA: I view Joanna and Miley as bonus daughters, hence why Scarlett calls them her sisters. Joanna and Miley do not view me as a mother figure in anyway, only as ‘dad’s girlfriend.’ It really hurts but i don’t think im pushy or anything. I just think of us as a blended family unit whereas Joanna and Miley have said im just the woman their dad is dating and Scarlett is nothing to them family wise. I have tried to get them to involve her whenever they’re doing stuff and they outright refuse so they only as they put it ‘tolerate her.’ Martin has chewed me out about this before, claiming I’m trying to insert my daughter in the friendship groups and activities of his daughters and it greatly upsets Scarlett because she just wants to be included. She doesn’t have a lot of friends and I want Joanna and Miley to be her friends.

I have no family and Scarlett’s fathers family aren’t involved. I’ve always tried my best to spoil her myself but it seems only fair since we’re part of Martin’s family now that she’s treated the same as Joanna and Miley.",9765,"The_final_frontier_","bfdaughterdrama",0

We were never BFFs or anything just pretty decent friends that have kept in contact over the years. Well recently she's been planning her wedding with her fiance and I got an invitation to come. I tell her that I should be able to come and it's not a problem. Well one night us and a few other friends are all hanging out and having a girls night out when she told us that she was having trouble finding someone to act as security for the wedding. She was wanting security because she feared her ex would show up and cause drama. Now Casey knows that I'm a police officer, but she doesn't know that I pull private security jobs some days on my time off to make a little extra money. One of our friends at the table we'll call her Sarah  knows that I do security and she brought it up, saying that I should consider doing it. 
Casey didn't say anything then but later when everyone else had left she asked me. She told me that she'd pay me for it. I told her that I wasn't willing to do it. I said that I'd be more than happy to see if one of my buddies would be willing to but I wanted to just enjoy the wedding and not have to work it and be treated like just a staff member, I wouldn't be able to eat or have any of the cake during the reception or anything. She ended up getting kinda mad at me and saying that I knew what her ex was like and that she'd prefer me to work it now that she knows that I do security as a second job.

I live far away from my family so mainly communicate over a family group chat. I don’t get to see them very often as it’s expensive to fly, and they all have kids too so it makes travelling a bit tricky. 

So when I messaged my family introducing my son with his name - Oliver, the general response was positive- however my brother and his wife (both nearly 40) sent me a nasty text and wouldn’t speak to me. I didn’t understand why as it was a short message and didn’t explain anything- just that they were angry about his name. Since they wouldn’t speak to me I rang my sister. She explained that they had taken offence and that they thought the name was too similar to their daughter’s name - Olivia…. She explained they were very angry with us and not willing to speak to us at the moment. I was completely shocked and it’s all been very upsetting. 

I’ve spoken to my parents and my other sister who are also very confused by their reaction.

We had been together since we were 13 so I was devastated and all I wanted was him back, but I've come to my senses and decided that someone who believes that school level punnet squares are the be all and end all of biological inheritance is not the type of person I wanna be with. I was also treated like crap by everyone but my older brother, Alex, while we were waiting for the results because they all thought I had cheated.

I'm sorry, never posted something like this before. 

To be brief; my husband is going to Miami with a friend for a long weekend. I think this is great and supported the idea of this trip since the beginning. 

We have a 17 year old daughter (his biological child, but I've been around since she was 5 years old. I love her to pieces.) He told me tonight that he informed our daughter 'Elisa ' that she could not leave the house nor stay overnight at any of her friends houses while he is on vacation. This was news to me as well (he mentioned this at dinner with all of us in the same room.)

Understandably upset, Elisa asked why and what had she done  to be punished. My husband said she had done nothing, but she needed to be home the entire time because that was the only way he could trust that I would stay home as well. He said he didn't trust me not to ""stay out and party all weekend"" unless Elisa was home and I had to take care of her. My party days are long behind me but he brings them up constantly, many many years after the fact.

Aside from the logic being incredibly flawed here, I'm frankly disturbed by the fact he will punish her and jam up her extended weekend as a tool to ensure I do what he wants me to do. 

I told him flat out I thought what he did was unfair to Elisa and a little sick. He's now telling me it's my fault he had to resort to this because he can't trust me.

Both of us had actually been applying to some other jobs as well, she got one of them so she's going to move out of state soon. I also got an offer but decided to stay here because of the promotion.

We had a family potluck over the weekend, and of course a lot of them had heard of my promotion and were congratulating me.

I (f36) is engaged to be married to my fiancée (m38) and we always agreed to have a very low key wedding without families as I have a big family in comparison to his and we would be paying for the wedding by ourselves. We always agreed that it will be just our friends who will be invited. This was because I had witnessed the stress my sister (f45) went under when inviting certain family members and I have always had told her that if I ever get married I would elope without any fuss. 

Since I got engaged my sister said she will be at my wedding despite that I said I will not be inviting any family members, not even our mum and dad. 

She asked if I will be inviting my best mate who has been through difficult period of my life and who I was a lot closer to than my own sister. And I said I don’t know. She then made a comment to our family members that I am choosing my best friend over blood despite that I haven’t decided. 

Recently I have found out my sister had betrayed my trust after I had asked her not to say something that had happened to me that was very personal to a family member. I knew she was close to this family member but thought that she would keep this to herself as I had told her that I would not be sharing this personal information with this family member. I found out that this family member had mentioned something that only could be shared directly from my sister. 

My sister doesn’t know I know and the more I think about who I want at the wedding, the more I don’t want my sister there. 

My sister can come across very negative and opinionated that it can upset me very deeply which is not what I want to happen on the wedding day. Plus when she got married, she never made the effort to get to know my now fiancé who I have been with for 15 odd years and had excluded him from the family wedding photo as well as made him sat by himself during her wedding ceremony as she wanted other family members she was close to near to the front.

She got mad at me and said I was judging her for her culture (She’s Indian) and that this was normal in Indian households.

I thought maybe I was being culturally insensitive so I googled about it but found nothing. After our talk, the next morning she sent me multiple paragraphs about how I will never understand her culture and that I should just accept her.

For context, my girlfriend has really strict traditional indian parents who are helicopter parents in every sense of the word. They are also super toxic and judgmental. I understand that Indian/immigrant parents are different/more strict than white American parents, but I definitely think her parents are a little too controlling and weird.

I (25M) am getting married next month to my fiancé (26F). We have been planning our wedding for over a year and we have a strict guest limit of 100 people due to the venue and our budget. We decided to invite only our closest family and friends, and we had to make some tough choices about who to include or exclude. 

One of the people we decided not to invite was my cousin (28M). He and I were never close growing up, and he has always been rude and disrespectful to me and my fiancé. He has made fun of our relationship, called us names, spread rumors about us, and tried to sabotage our engagement party. He is also a notorious troublemaker who likes to cause drama and start fights at family gatherings. He has been banned from several relatives’ homes for his behavior. 

My aunt (his mom) called me yesterday and demanded to know why I didn’t send him an invitation. She said he was hurt and angry that I excluded him from such an important event in my life. She said he deserved to be there as my family and that I was being selfish and petty. She also threatened to boycott the wedding if I didn’t change my mind. 

I told her that I was sorry she felt that way, but I had no intention of inviting him. I said he had done nothing but disrespect me and my fianceé and I didn’t want him to ruin our special day. I said it was my wedding and I had the right to decide who to invite or not. I said I loved her and hoped she would still come, but I understood if she chose not to. 

She hung up on me and later sent me a long text message calling me a horrible person and a bad cousin. She said I was breaking the family apart and that I would regret my decision. She also said she was not coming to the wedding and neither were any of her other relatives who sided with her. 

I feel bad that I upset her and caused a rift in the family, but I also feel like I don’t owe my cousin anything after how he treated me. My fiancé supports me and says he doesn’t want him there either. Most of my other relatives are on my side too, but some think I should have invited him to keep the peace.

This has been quite a shock to most people as they seemed to be having to issues out of the ordinary. However, I have been the one privy to the information of why they are divorcing.

It's because of my sister ""Anne"" (26 F). Anne is a deadbeat. She has never worked more than 14 hours a week since getting expelled from college for multiple acts of cheating and code of conduct violations 5 years ago. All she does is sit at home most days watching TV or going over to her loser boyfriend's house to get high. She feels no need to support herself and expects my parents to carry her through life. She's been in therapy since she was 14 but cannot keep one for more than a year because she gets dropped as a client due to her lying and inability to show up to appointments. My parents have spent over a decade trying to get some mental issue pinned down for Anne and all they've gotten is she's just a lazy narcissist.

Last year my Mom decided enough was enough and planned to kick Anne to the curb and wash her hands of her. Dad disagreed, and in the end, the two's marriage got torn apart. I know because both have come to me basically admitting that if Anne was not a factor divorce would not even be a consideration. 

I don't get along with Anne for a variety of reasons. She has always been a bully and owes me a large sum of money at the moment. The thing that boils my blood though is that she's oblivious to the situation between our parents, or just doesn't care. She had a literal tantrum when the possibility of the house being sold came up because she didn't want to have to move to an apartment with my dad. 

Last night I found myself at my parent's house and had the misfortune of talking to Anne. Anne mentioned that she's getting really sick of my mom's ""melodramatic shit"" and not just leaving the house to her and my dad. Something struck me at that moment and I just asked Anne if she really does not care that she's such a selfish, garbage, waste of space human that she's driven her parents to get a divorce. I elaborated, and told her the full truth that she is in fact the only reason they are getting a divorce because mom's finally realized that there is no hope Anne will ever grow up.

The shitstorm this caused was massive. Anne acted as if I sold her out to the Romans and my parents argued between ""she deserves to know"" and ""we told you that in confidence."" Because Anne cannot keep her mouth shut either, the entire extended family has begun to hear too.

Last year I was invited to Tom's family's Christmas party, everything was fine until Lily said something like ""Oh God Eni, you've already eaten so much, at this pace you'll stop being Pigni to become Whalni"" and she laugh with the children at the party.

Lily got super serious and she told me it wasn't funny, to which I said ""come on, it's a joke"" and imitated her laugh, the kids at the party laughed too and Lily ran away while she cried.

I really like this guy and it's my first proper relationship as I have always been a bit too busy with work for a relationship but I really wanna put in the effort and enjoy myself and overcome my anxieties. Yesterday I told my sister(25F) that I plan on going with this guy to a restaurant that she has been wanting to try out and basically said ""Oh hey I can try it out with my date and then you and I can go together if it's good"" and that's when she got upset with me. She looked visibly hurt and I feel terrible. She asked if I even thought about bringing her too on this date so she can also get to know the guy and I told her I did but thought for a third date it might be too early for them to get to know each other. I also want to get to know this guy with it just being us alone. She hasn't really talked to me since that and is acting very cold toward me. I tried to ask her if she wants to be the one I take first and she blew up on me saying that I m in the wrong for not wanting it to be the three of us on this date cause she just wants to get to know him as well...so it seems like it's not about the restaurant and more of I didn't want to go with her and this has me confused.

I feel very conflicted because on one hand I want to be alone with my date and on the other hand I don't want my sister to be upset with me, she has also been having a difficult time at work so it's been difficult because I can't even really be excited around her about this new relationship, I noticed in the beginning when I do this I was getting one word answers or short answers from her so I dialed it down. I know it's not her fault that she is stressed and I obviously wouldn't want her to pretend to be in a great mood just cause I m in a new relationship, so I understand.

I have considered just folding and asking her if she will go with me but I also really don't want to so maybe I really am just being an asshole.

Am  I the asshole here for not wanting her to go with me?

EDIT - I feel a lot less conflicted about the situation now.

For the past few weeks, my depression has worsened with school and work. Hence, I stopped eating properly. After finding out about this, my twin brother flew to manchester(where I'm staying) from London(where he's studying) to cook meals for me.

You have no idea why they’re choosing to, there might be a lot of a lot of good reasons why they’ve chosen to do this (for example they don’t know if they want to make it a long term thing and so they want to minimise impact on the group, or there might be other dynamics you don’t know about for example history with others)

You can’t assume you know all the facts on someone’s close intimate relationships. You should apologise in my opinion",6,0,14,14,"For the context, we are all in our early twenties. Have been good friends for a year now.

So we have a friend group of 5 people and due to university, we see each other every day. Two of my friends have clearly been dating each other but they try to hide it. It is a miserable hiding process to be honest. 

It is their first relationship (everyone has been way too busy with school to have a relationship before, especially these two friends) and they are both introverts. It has been 3 months and they haven't still told any of us. 

They say they're going home but they go together and all and it is very obvious. So I decided to help. They were clearly uncomfortable coming up with a lie every time they met. It was clear anyways. So I gathered everyone (4/5 of the group) and said it is hard enough having to deal with everything. Why go around playing roles if it is so obvious you are dating?

They said they wanted to wait and that it was their first relationship and they wanted to tell us later. I said then they should have tried to hide it better. They're mad at me. AITA",14,"advivealtaccount","iceQueen192938",0
"AITA for calling an 11 year old a dumbass?","I think that your action was justified but not the language. I’m sure you were probably angry upon hearing Audrey’s bs explanation but maybe it would have been better to step out for a second, collect your thoughts, and then address the situation. There was no need to call her a dumbass but she clearly needed to be talked to sternly. It may have gone better if instead you said something like “Audrey, I saw you break the cat tree. There’s no need to blame Sophie. If you would have just apologized and told the truth I would be a lot less upset than you refusing to take responsibility for something you clearly did. Because you responded that way I’m going to have to talk to your mom about this because that was incredibly unfair to your sister”.  I will say though your sister handled that terribly. “Kids break things, it’s what they do”. Yeah. Duh. While you were upset about your broken cat tree you were more upset about your niece constantly being mean to Sophie. Your sister should have also offered to replace the cat tree. If she’s basically calling you poor for not buying another than she should have no problem replenishing it herself.",4,0,667,667,"I have two nieces. One is an angel (Sophie), one is a spoiled brat (Audrey). Audrey is the eldest and gets everything she wants, always her way.

Well both my nieces were over. We were playing charades, having a very nice time and Audrey rolled off the bed onto my cat tree and straight annihilated it. Like, she's a skinny girl, but she completely destroyed the thing. When I asked her for an apology she blamed Sophie and said Sophie broke it. I was bewildered and responded ""I saw you do it, dumbass!""  

Audrey didn't like this response. Usually if she blames Sophie she gets away with it, so she called her mom crying about how mean I am, telling her what I called her. The mom took her side and said ""kids break things. It's what they do,"" insulted me, and when I asked if she could help me buy a new one, she poor-shamed me ""what, you're too broke to buy another?"" Which is unfortunately true.

Then the dad texted me more insults and said I had no right taking care of any children because of my foul language (while his language was pretty colorful itself). I could've not cussed and taken a different approach but I was honestly fed up. Now I'm out of a cat tree and my family is very angry with me. Am I the asshole?

Edit: Thank you for all the insightful replies! For those wondering, I did apologize to Audrey for my choice of language. I explained why I reacted the way I did, that I reacted in anger which was inappropriate, and I told her it was wrong of me to call her a name.  I told her I really just wanted her to own up to it and apologize, to not lie and blame others but take accountability for her actions. She said ""you don't even know what I've been through, bitch"" so I'm not sure I got my point across, but I did attempt to make it right on my end! 

Also yes, I was babysitting for free!

Alright so I (F22) have been friends with let's call her Casey (F22) since we were in middle school. We were never BFFs or anything just pretty decent friends that have kept in contact over the years. Well recently she's been planning her wedding with her fiance and I got an invitation to come. I tell her that I should be able to come and it's not a problem. Well one night us and a few other friends are all hanging out and having a girls night out when she told us that she was having trouble finding someone to act as security for the wedding. She was wanting security because she feared her ex would show up and cause drama. Now Casey knows that I'm a police officer, but she doesn't know that I pull private security jobs some days on my time off to make a little extra money. One of our friends at the table we'll call her Sarah  knows that I do security and she brought it up, saying that I should consider doing it. 
Casey didn't say anything then but later when everyone else had left she asked me. She told me that she'd pay me for it. I told her that I wasn't willing to do it. I said that I'd be more than happy to see if one of my buddies would be willing to but I wanted to just enjoy the wedding and not have to work it and be treated like just a staff member, I wouldn't be able to eat or have any of the cake during the reception or anything. She ended up getting kinda mad at me and saying that I knew what her ex was like and that she'd prefer me to work it now that she knows that I do security as a second job. She said that I was being unfair and that it questions my friendship with her now. So AITA?

Did you ever stop and think about the stress on an innocent dog who has no clue what is happening and why it's happening. And you did this to simply teach your daughter a lesson, yeah you are the biggest AH I can think of.",1,0,896,896,"(i made a mistake in the title, sorry, it should be ""for giving away"")

My daughter (10) wanted a puppy for her birthday so my wife and I went to a shelter and picked a puppy for her, we made it very clear that she had to be responsible for it. That means that she'll have to clean after him, feed him and checking his water bowl, etc. We would hire a trainer and would take him to the vet when it was needed, but besides that she had to take care of it. 

During the first month things were okay, she did as she promised. But now (over two months since she got the puppy) she complains about having to clean when the dog poops or pees on the floor and when she had to take care of him. This week she reached the last straw because she forgot to give him water, my wife had to fill his bowl because she didn't do it. 

I told her this is enough because a dog is not a toy and she promised to be responsible. I contacted some friends/ family and asked them if they wanted the puppy. Finally a coworker said she wanted it and I took him to her house. 

My daughter is very sad now but I think she needs to learn a lesson here. My parents told me I was being unfair because deep down I knew that my daughter was gonna fail in being responsible and I set her up for failure. They think that as a dad I need to teach them but not punish them the first time they make a mistake. Are they right?

I was really young when we first started dating and the nagging of my MIL, wanting us to have kids early, always bothered me. I took my complaints to my fiancé but he dismissed me saying that i should ""understand his mother's ways"". I didn't get her hopes up about me having kids, because i always said that i wanted to mature enough to be able to raise a kid.

As i said, i just dismissed her nagging, until last week.

My fiancé came home from work (that btw he works with his mother), saying: ""I was with mom all that in the office,and after she told me some things i came to the conclusion that you should stop taking your birth control pills"". Unbelievable. Didn't even want to argue about something this ridiculous.

Time passed and we didn't touch this issue anymore.

The weekend came, and we went to visit my MIL's house, she took me to her room saying she needed to have a word with me and my fiancé.

She sat down on the bed and said: ""I had a discussion with Luiz (my fiancé's name), and i told him about my concern with you guys not having children at the appropriate age. Who knows if you're going to be able to have children with this disease of yours? As for now, he will no longer allow you to buy the birth control pills per my request""

(He never buyed them for me, i work 9 hours a day and everything i buy for myself comes from my money)

About ""my disease"": It's a disease that all the women in my father's side had: Uterus Cancer. My great-great-grandmother passed due to it, my great-grandmother too and my grandma had it after giving birth to my father, but the doctors took the uterus out before the cancer could spread further. My grandma was always cautious with me. Never had any issues, and i go to the gynecologist 2 times a year to do exams.

 I got enraged, and looked at my fiancé who was sitting beside her, and he just averted his eyes.

""you will regret leaving the thoughts of having kids after your graduation, because god time is now and i got a revelation from the pastor that one of my family members is going to try to have kids and it's not gonna be able to. I'm sure that person is you, and i'm worried for my son. I can't leave this marriage be if your thoughts don't align.""

When she said that last line, i exploded, saying ""Are you so desperate for me to sit on your son's cock and have a baby so what? It's not your business if we're having kids or not or if we're having sex or not, this must be a joke"".

The argument escalated but i don't remember much because i got so enraged that i started trembling and had to go home to calm myself down alone, as i left my fiancé there.

When he came home, he was pissed off saying that i disrespected his mother and that if i didn't apologise he would consider breaking off the engagement. Honestly am not making any effort to set things straight as i'm very offended by everything she said.

Update: from what everyone has said I am clearly NTA. Thank you all for your concern and well wishes. Ana and her family have been blocked and I will no longer be in contact with her. 

It was also brought up to me by another user that their was a similar post posted a few weeks ago from a hosts perspective. This is NOT the same post. My situation happened really recently (allot more recent than whatever the previous post was) I’m shocked to hear this has happened befor, but yeah it’s 💯 not related to ours haha


Finally I’ve had a few comments about my dog being “certified” that I want to clarify. I am not from the US so I’m unsure what your guys process is like, but all I mean is that Bailey has gone through the required testing, training and registration to ensure she is legally aloud to be classified as a service animal :) 


I just want to start by saying I’m pretty sure I’m not the A-hole. But my friend and her family are pretty certain that I am. Please bear with me, I’m just wanting some clarity over this situation to make sure I’m not crazy.

I (24 f) have epilepsy. I have a service dog (fully certified) who is trained to help me with my seizures. I have been diagnosed since a child, and I have had my current dog Bailey for 4 years now and she is the bestest girl around. (Before Bailey I had a previous service dog who we had to retire due to age… but having a service animal is by no means new for me). With her being a service dog she is obviously always with me. 

I have a core friend group who hangs out quite often. My one friend; let’s call her Anna) (also 24f) always makes really weird and almost passive aggressive comments about me and Bailey? Ex; dogs shouldn’t come to restaurants, I’m inconveniencing people, etc. she doesn’t get that I legitimately need her for my own safety. It’s not just for show.

My seizures are really regular; for context I actually get two different kinds. My “small ones” are petit Mal seizures. This essentially just looks like I’m zoning out and staring into space. Quite often people who don’t know me wouldn’t even connect this. My “big ones” are my main concern; these are focal seizures where I fully lose consciousness. This can happen a couple times a day for me so it’s obviously really important that I manage it to the best of my abilities. 

Anyways. Our friend Anna wanted to host a games night/appy night type thing at her house. When we there she lost it on me. She told me it was increadibly disrespectful that I showed up with Bailey without asking for permission first. That I can’t just assume people will be happy with a dog always being around. That I should have just stayed home if I couldn’t handle being out for a few hours without Bailey. I tried apologizing and pointing out that I assumed she knew I was bringing her since I’ve never gone anywhere without her. That set her off more. The guys were finally able to calm her down but her “compromise” was I had to put Bailey in the backyard.

I was an idiot and said fine because I didn’t want to inconvenience anyone more or continue stirring the pot. Bailey went out side and I returned inside with my friends. 

I ended up having a seizure, blacking out and smashing my head on the floor. I had to go to the hospital because of how hard I hit my head. 

I guess my friend group absolutely handed Ana her ass calling her hateful, toxic, and a jealous witch. I guess she was trying to say that I passed out for the attention and I got my way like always. Long story short no one wants her around anymore.

Caden is very obsessed with seeming masculine, and he takes a lot of pride in his personal style. He has a decent following on YouTube  and TikTok, and his “brand” is basically about being a player and attracting girls.

Well, he was making a video yesterday with some fairly expensive jeans he copped from a local custom designer. They are light pink and he was having trouble finding a shirt to match. He came out to the kitchen complaining, and I told him to wear this tee I got for his birthday last month. I told him the pattern had some pink in it and would match well with pink jeans.

Caden immediately started yelling and kicking off. He insisted that they weren’t pink, and accused me of gaslighting him. He said they were red and I just had an agenda of masculating him. These jeans are literally rose pink, so I was definitely not gaslighting him.

He called our mom at work (this was during her lunch hour) and told her what I said. My mom took Caden’s side and accused me of raining on my brothers parade by making him feel bad about his new clothes. I replied that I don’t think guys wearing pink is bad, and Caden is just making drama over nothing.

Now Caden won’t wear the jeans, and because they aren’t returnable, my mom wants me to reimburse him the cost of the jeans. There’s no way I’m doing that.

It is their first relationship (everyone has been way too busy with school to have a relationship before, especially these two friends) and they are both introverts. It has been 3 months and they haven't still told any of us. 

They say they're going home but they go together and all and it is very obvious. So I decided to help. They were clearly uncomfortable coming up with a lie every time they met. It was clear anyways. So I gathered everyone (4/5 of the group) and said it is hard enough having to deal with everything. Why go around playing roles if it is so obvious you are dating?

I mean she didn’t take your advice to take it easy when you gave it so why should she take it easy now.  It’s very inconvenient for you.   

Get a part time job, book your own gigs, leave her alone to recover at her pace.   Mental health is serious",1,0,5,5,"I (26F) and my friend Jill (27F) are comedians. I recently started my career while Jill is already kind of a huge deal. We began doing a monthly show together that’s been a great success, mostly due to Jill’s popularity.

Now, Jill is an extremely hard worker. She never rests and does up to 9 gigs a week even if they’re not paid. She makes a good living, but always claims she just can’t stop and for the last six months her mental health took a toll from that. Basically every time I see her, she cries, seems burnt out and severely depressed. 
I always listen to her, helped her in “firing” her toxic therapist that made her feel way worse, advised her to work less, seek help from a doctor, maybe get some meds and even offered to find a new therapist for her. She mostly didn’t follow my advice but seemed to be doing better. 

For today, we had an interview scheduled with a big newspaper, but a few days ago Jill sent an email about how she’s a going to stay with family for the rest of the month to focus on getting better and maybe the interviewer could do the article about just me (obviously not happening because they wanted to to talk to us as a team and I’m not remotely as famous as she is). That sucks, but well, what can I do.

Then today, Jill texted me about canceling our show next month because she decided she’ll extend her stay to the end of April and also doesn’t want to fixate a new date for the gig. Which really sucks because I need the money (300-400$) and people have already bought their tickets. Also, I don’t really see how staying with her parents is supposed to help because apparently the pressure they apply on her is a significant contributor to her mental health crisis.

Ofc I feel terrible for her, but I also feel like I’ve been the one who’s been there for her through all of this even though it made me depressed and anxious as well, and now, after I’ve been telling her for years before that to tone it down and take some time for herself, which she ignored, she now just disappears knowing very well how this affects me (I struggle financially while Jill can always count on her parents helping her out with money and also has a savings account).

Update: from what everyone has said I am clearly NTA. Thank you all for your concern and well wishes. Ana and her family have been blocked and I will no longer be in contact with her. 

It was also brought up to me by another user that their was a similar post posted a few weeks ago from a hosts perspective. This is NOT the same post. My situation happened really recently (allot more recent than whatever the previous post was) I’m shocked to hear this has happened befor, but yeah it’s 💯 not related to ours haha


Finally I’ve had a few comments about my dog being “certified” that I want to clarify. I am not from the US so I’m unsure what your guys process is like, but all I mean is that Bailey has gone through the required testing, training and registration to ensure she is legally aloud to be classified as a service animal :) 


I just want to start by saying I’m pretty sure I’m not the A-hole. But my friend and her family are pretty certain that I am. Please bear with me, I’m just wanting some clarity over this situation to make sure I’m not crazy.

I (24 f) have epilepsy. I have a service dog (fully certified) who is trained to help me with my seizures. I have been diagnosed since a child, and I have had my current dog Bailey for 4 years now and she is the bestest girl around. (Before Bailey I had a previous service dog who we had to retire due to age… but having a service animal is by no means new for me). With her being a service dog she is obviously always with me. 

I have a core friend group who hangs out quite often. My one friend; let’s call her Anna) (also 24f) always makes really weird and almost passive aggressive comments about me and Bailey? Ex; dogs shouldn’t come to restaurants, I’m inconveniencing people, etc. she doesn’t get that I legitimately need her for my own safety. It’s not just for show.

My seizures are really regular; for context I actually get two different kinds. My “small ones” are petit Mal seizures. This essentially just looks like I’m zoning out and staring into space. Quite often people who don’t know me wouldn’t even connect this. My “big ones” are my main concern; these are focal seizures where I fully lose consciousness. This can happen a couple times a day for me so it’s obviously really important that I manage it to the best of my abilities. 

Anyways. Our friend Anna wanted to host a games night/appy night type thing at her house. When we there she lost it on me. She told me it was increadibly disrespectful that I showed up with Bailey without asking for permission first. That I can’t just assume people will be happy with a dog always being around. That I should have just stayed home if I couldn’t handle being out for a few hours without Bailey. I tried apologizing and pointing out that I assumed she knew I was bringing her since I’ve never gone anywhere without her. That set her off more. The guys were finally able to calm her down but her “compromise” was I had to put Bailey in the backyard.

I was an idiot and said fine because I didn’t want to inconvenience anyone more or continue stirring the pot. Bailey went out side and I returned inside with my friends.

You need to face facts that your daughter is a woman, and you no longer have a say in her affairs unless she asks for your input.
Not sure how you managed to ground a grown adult in your other post tbh.",1,0,69,69,"The last time I posted on here about my daughter it didn't go too well for me, so I am trying again.

I (50F) have a daughter (19F) who now goes to school in another state. She is in a long-distance relationship with her boyfriend (19M). For storytelling purposes, we will say my daughter is Rachel and her boyfriend is Mike.

Rachel is a super busy student, but she somehow manages to work 20 hours a week to make enough money to support herself. I honestly couldn't be more proud of her. She has amazing grades, has found an activity she really likes, and seems to take good care of herself. Mike also goes to college, makes good grades from what I hear, and is in the process of getting a research job. 

My daughter has a huge heart, and always wants to make sure she gets to see Mike. Recently, with her college refund checks, she has been paying for his flights to come to see her and trying to pay so they can do nice things. I have warned her against this multiple times, and I feel like my claims fall on deaf ears. He finally has a job, but I am still wary of the amount of money they spend on seeing each other. 

This past week was her spring break and I was so happy to catch up and hear about her and Mike's trip to Chicago when they went up together for a weekend. She told me how expensive it was and how she ended up getting a credit card without consulting me first. She told me she was planning a trip in 2024 to Mexico for her and Mike and I immediately said she can't go. She told me the decision was ultimately up to her and Mike, and that I couldn't keep her from going. I told her she was being financially irresponsible again and she told me she didn't care what I thought. Her debt is being paid off with a solid plan to pay it off in three months. 

We argued back and forth and I told her she would not have my support if she went on this trip she said that was fine and she didn't care. Mike and his family support her.

&#x200B;

I know I shouldn't have yelled at her, but I love and care about my child. I don't want to see her go into debt over some silly trip to Mexico. Some of my friends say I'm the asshole for trying to tell a grown working woman how to spend her money, but some others understand I just don't want to see her in debt.

She’s at home for spring break from college and she just casually mentions that her mom bathed her last night.

I did a double take and I’m like “huh?” And she got defensive and got mad at me for being judgmental. She got mad at me and said I was judging her for her culture (She’s Indian) and that this was normal in Indian households. I have lots of Indian friends and I never once heard of them getting bathed as fully grown adults.

I thought maybe I was being culturally insensitive so I googled about it but found nothing. After our talk, the next morning she sent me multiple paragraphs about how I will never understand her culture and that I should just accept her.

For context, my girlfriend has really strict traditional indian parents who are helicopter parents in every sense of the word. They are also super toxic and judgmental. I understand that Indian/immigrant parents are different/more strict than white American parents, but I definitely think her parents are a little too controlling and weird.

She wanted to ensure you had a place to stay and leave the funds for her children. You are 100% NTA and If I were you I would either block the aunts or warn them that there will be no further discussions re: your inheritance if they wish to remain in contact.",1,0,2624,2624,"I (25F) recently lost my mother to cancer. Me and my brother (35M) are her only children. For the past 7 years, I’ve been staying in an apartment my mother bought. She always told me that when she died, she wanted me to have it because she worked so hard to ensure  I always had somewhere to live. So when she died, she left me the apartment in the will. My brother has no issue with this, he makes more than enough of his own money and actually owns an apartment in the same building. 

However, my aunts (A and B) have an issue with this. A has had money issues for as long as I’ve known her and my mother was always helping her out with money when she was alive. B is financially stable, but in no position to help A. They both think that since I make enough money to be able to rent a place, I should let A stay in the apartment and rent my own because that’s what my mother would have wanted. 

I said no, stating that my mother wanted me to have a place of my own. I am currently saving all the money I would have used on rent and intend to buy my own house when I have enough saved. 

When I said no, they then suggested that I should share some of the money my mother left me with them. She had two life insurance policies, both of which went only to my brother and I. She also left us the house and her car. Basically, everything was split between my brother and I and no one else got anything. My aunts feel that this was wrong and that they, especially A, deserve some of the money. 

My brother blocked them all on platforms when they asked this of him and suggests I do the same, but I feel guilty about cutting off my family. 

But I also feel strongly that if my mother wanted them to get money, she would have left them something. But she didn’t. She chose to leave EVERYTHING to my brother and I. My aunts are saying that my mother did that because she assumed we would share. But I knew my mother. She would have told me if she wanted me to do that. All she said was that she wanted to die knowing that me and my brother would be able to support ourselves.

"AITA for having my neighbor fined every time his dog comes into my yard?","NTA",1,0,445,445,"I rent a house, I have a neighbour on one side with no fence between our yards. They got a dog last year, which they let roam freely on both sides. They used to come clean up after it and apologize, but did not build a fence or tie it up. My backyard is a 'naturalized area', which is allowed in my town, mostly a wildflower pollinator meadow, with a smaller grass area. The garden was already there when I moved in a few years ago. This neighbour used to come and mow down all my flowers, saying it's embarrassing to have his friends over and see them (separate issue). Now he says he 'has' to do it to find his dogs waste. My landlord used to live on the property, they never mowed the meadow when he lived there. My gate on the opposite side of the house from his was a bit loose, he came and installed an automatic gate closer on MY gate, so that my kids can't accidentally let his dog out. 

The dog chews my kids toys, it ripped my back screen door, pees on my deck. In winter they started only coming to clean up the dog feces about once a week..they get buried in snow and can't be found. Eventually three weeks go by without anyone cleaning up. Once the wife saw the dog crap and she told me that she wasn't going to pick it up, her husband wanted a dog so he has to do it. He was at work. Finally I go to speak with them seriously, but they start yelling that 'he does so much work on my property', it's a 'shared yard' (it's not), 'they can't tell their dog what to do', that I need to build a door on my deck to keep the dog off of it, and I'm just lazy for not having a real lawn and leaving my kids toys outside. 

At this point I feel an adult discussion is not going to happen so I called bylaw, and they are fining him a few hundred dollars every time the dog crosses the property line, and another fine if no one cleans up its waste. Now they are furious and told me that I 'started a war'. The landlord already offered a long time ago to pay for half the cost of a fence with them. AITA?

My Dad doesn't work and my mom lost her job, so I have been paying for half the bills.
Last autumn, my Dad got himself a new tablet, and Galaxy watch 5 for his birthday.

When Christmas came, I set aside 700 dollars for presents for my family. Needless to say, I didn't end up getting anything for Christmas or my birthday last month, or the year before, I also graduated last year, to which my parents promised me a party, which also didn't happen.

All I requested was a 600 dollar computer.

Fast forward about a month ago, I got a new phone, it was a straight upgrade, s23, though our provider just paid tax, and I was super excited! I finally have something that works! My dad decided that he WANTS a new phone too and found 1200 laying around to get the s23 ultra, and got a pair of galaxy buds too (which is what I asked for, for my birthday a year prior, and still didn't get anything) the next day while he was bragging I told him that I was upset, to which I was just told I'm being a selfish brat, and he never buys himself anything.

I understand that it's his money, and by no means would I want to take it from him, but every single time, he wants something new, we suddenly has the money, and when I ask for something for my birthday, there's a reason I'm paying bills.

Backstory:My mother and my cousin's mother are sisters. I( 27M) am the only child of my parents and my cousin(27F)(sis in the story) has a bio brother(22M) whom I'll refer as lil bro.

So back when I lived in my home country sis was the absolute golden child for everyone and everytime you met her she had a new activity like dance, singing, drawing or a new competition in some such activities that she won. I on the other had was pretty reserved and just went by school books and a few ""nerdy"" activities. High-school was a big blow for her she stopped excelling at all and at the same time I was having the time of my life. And she got some health issues not at all life threatening but she blamed them for everything. I in hs took what here in USA can be seen as taking all the science APs you can get and since I was sure about this I told sis about this when she was entering hs and she copied me. She barely did enough to get into college I on the other hand got tons of scholarships and got in an ivy league. Now I work in a big pharma company on a high end salary. 

Bro took non science and is doing well himself.

The disease was a minor hormonal balance just a pill a day and she would be finebut she just used it as an excuse for flunking,etc. She told lil bro and he told me. So we are the only 3 people who know the truth.

Sis was really hostile during our childhood and even had a breakdown on my wedding reception. In a word she is an attention whore. She is married to a guy from our home country and now is a sahm they live here too but about a 10 hr drive away from us.

I and my wife(American) both work, have a nice house and are in a really good place in life.

Last week my grandparents, my parents and her parents and lil bro were visiting us and they decided to do a reunion. It was done at my place as it was closest to the airport.

Now comes the day when they get here and the drama begins she is going up to everyone one by one and asking how bad her hs years were and if it weren't for her disease how well she would have done and all the bs yk. All while this was happening my wife and I were in the kitchen and not aware of what was happening in the living room. Afterwards when she comes to ask me,her words,"" op you were a real tryhard in school how do you HONESTLY think I would have fared if not for the disease""  I told her that I don't think she would have done good even if she didn't have any illness as she took the hardest course and she had shaky science from the beginning.She was fuming and thenvout of nowhere blamed it on my wife for ""changing"" me. Needless to say she was kicked and her husband and parents followed. Lil bro stayed with us. He later told me she went around asking everyone.
Now I'm getting messages saying I've brainwashed bro for staying and what not. Wife is saying I should've read the room and I think that is the only thing I could have done.

So AITA?

Edit: Forgot mention she isn't suffering from that thing anymore. It went away with her puberty. And yeah it was thyroid but she got the lowest possible dose on the market that. And yeah she wasn't that ill as she still did all the stuff not related to school i.e. her extracurricular and competitions. 
 
Also I don't have a grudge against her.

We will often go to charity shops, second hand shops and retro video game stores and look for old games we want to buy and play. We will go to shops hunting for a certain game (usually different games from eachother) but my friend always goes into these stores and looks for me. He will ask the staff if they have the game, he will check the shelves, the whole lot. If he doesn't find it, he will come over and tell me before I have even had a chance to have a proper look. If he does find it, he will bring it to me.

Obviously this is just my friend trying to be helpful, but I find it incredibly annoying. Sometimes we will go on long journeys to these stores and I just wanna take my time and check them out and maybe eventually find the game I am looking for. But my friend doesn't even seem to look for himself a lot of the time, he just looks for me... I have asked him nicely a few times that this really gets on my nerves and I'd like him to stop because it kinda takes the fun out of 'hunting' for the game I'd like; but he carries on doing it.

This last November I asked him to marry me and we booked our wedding venue for June of this year, we want to get married as soon as we can because we’re not big fans of weddings. My parents aren’t homophobic or anything, nor are his parents, we’re just not too fond of weddings. 

My parents are wealthy, my father being a successful self made millionaire (or maybe billionaire, we’ve never discussed that type of information). They want to pay for our wedding since they have paid my other siblings weddings and I’m the only one who’s not married, because if I’m honest love hasn’t been easy for me.

My mental health do not excuse my actions, it’s just an explanation so you can understand this more. 

My mother and I have an okay relationship but I keep my distance, she never believed in therapists and such, she had a hard time accepting that I was mentally ill, and so did my father, but he’s not as controlling or invasive as she is. My mother has always been very critical, she never approved any of my partners but I’m sure my boyfriend is the one she dislikes the most, she have told me before that she doesn’t approve him.

During this time I suffered from ptsd and anorexia, it took a long time to rebuild my life. Some of the group took his side and were not happy I was taking it to court. F1 would repeatedly harass me blocking my car in, threatening me and turn up where I was, including my house at all hours of the night. In the end I had to tell her, I would also take her to court if she did not back off. She backed off. 

The wedding is this year I was asked to be bridesmaid and happily accepted. 6 months later I see a post that my sister has asked F1 to be a bridesmaid. I feel disrespected and that I do not feel comfortable with this person. Please note the bridal party was meant to get ready at my house and there's no way F1 is setting foot in my house. I don't want to be bridesmaid but my parents say I should keep the peace. I will still go to the wedding and support my sister, but want nothing to do with f1.

"AITA for telling my roommate’s bf that I’m a stripper?","That's her problem, not yours. She's obviously insecure. Never be ashamed of being you!",1,0,3467,3467,"I (21f) have been a stripper for about a year now. I’m open about it with people, my family knows what I do, I’m not ashamed of it at all. I was on the verge of being homeless when I started and now just recently I was able to pay my rent for a year.

I have 2 roommates. They know what I do, asked some questions about it in the beginning but they’re very accepting. People in our age group don’t tend to care.

The issue:

I was in the kitchen making myself some dinner when my roommate(also 21f) walked in with her boyfriend. He’s coming to visit for a few days. They started making themselves some food as well so we exchanged some small talk. He asked what I’m studying in school and I told him that I’m taking a break from school for a few months and pretty much just focusing on work. He asked what I do for work and I told him I’m a stripper. He was pretty much like “oh cool” and we moved on.

I finished up and went back into my room to eat. Didn’t think anything of it but I got a text from my roommate later that night. She said she “really didn’t appreciate me telling her bf that I’m a stripper especially dressed the way I was.” 

I was confused bc I was wearing shorts and a tank top which is what I literally always wear around the house and I also didn’t know her bf was coming so it’s not like I was planning it out. I told her that I’m sorry she was uncomfortable but i tell anyone who asks what I do because I’m not ashamed of it and I was just wearing what I normally do.

She said that “I should know better than anyone what a male mind is going to imagine when they see a woman wearing revealing clothes who then says she gets naked for money.” Then said that I’m used to seeking out male attention.

I truly didn’t know how to respond and still don’t, the conversation made me pretty uncomfortable and I’ve pretty much just tried to stay in my room the past few days. I am aware that the nature of my job is sexual and I know that some men will “fetishize” me for lack of a better word. So I do understand why she’d be upset about it I just don’t think I did anything directly wrong?

Edit: Yes I could afford to move out if I wanted to but I live in an expensive city and figured why bother because I could save more and have never had an issue with my roommates before. We all renewed our leases last month

"AITA for suggesting my stepson (16M) moves out?","YTA: telling your son your suggestion is where you messed up. Because now your son is going to poke at his older brother until he gets his way. You have alienated the older boy in his own home just because you want special treatment for you son.",2,0,2864,2864,"My husband and I have 6 children total and live in 4 bedroom house. We have two sons together (8 & 6), I have a son from a previous relationship (15), and I have 3 step children (20F, 16M & 16F). We live in a 4 bedroom house and for most the time we lived there we had 2 kids per room with the youngest boys sharing, the older boys sharing and the girls sharing. 

Things changed a couple years ago. My oldest stepdaughter finished school and is attending university locally. The girls decided at this point that instead of sharing a bedroom at their dads and sharing a bedroom at their mums, they would each take 1 room as their permanent bedroom. So the 16 yr old lives with us full time and the 20 yr old lives with her mum full time. They both visit the other parents house regularly. 

My 16 yr old stepson has his own bedroom at his mum's house but still splits time between each parents house mostly 50/50. My son lives full time with us as he doesn't have much of a relationship with his dad. My son and stepson do not get on that well and they can often be heard screaming at each other in their bedroom. 

Recently, I asked my stepson why he doesn't move to live full time with his mum so he and my son can have a similar arrangement as their sisters. This way both of the boys would have their own rooms. He would obviously still visit like his older sister does and we could figure something out like a futon instead of a bed in their room so my son has more space when stepson's not there.

"AITA for suggesting my stepson (16M) moves out?","Yta. You're throwing a child out of your house because you've had too many to properly care for.",2,0,2864,2864,"My husband and I have 6 children total and live in 4 bedroom house. We have two sons together (8 & 6), I have a son from a previous relationship (15), and I have 3 step children (20F, 16M & 16F). We live in a 4 bedroom house and for most the time we lived there we had 2 kids per room with the youngest boys sharing, the older boys sharing and the girls sharing. 

Things changed a couple years ago. My oldest stepdaughter finished school and is attending university locally. The girls decided at this point that instead of sharing a bedroom at their dads and sharing a bedroom at their mums, they would each take 1 room as their permanent bedroom. So the 16 yr old lives with us full time and the 20 yr old lives with her mum full time. They both visit the other parents house regularly. 

My 16 yr old stepson has his own bedroom at his mum's house but still splits time between each parents house mostly 50/50. My son lives full time with us as he doesn't have much of a relationship with his dad. My son and stepson do not get on that well and they can often be heard screaming at each other in their bedroom. 

Recently, I asked my stepson why he doesn't move to live full time with his mum so he and my son can have a similar arrangement as their sisters. This way both of the boys would have their own rooms. He would obviously still visit like his older sister does and we could figure something out like a futon instead of a bed in their room so my son has more space when stepson's not there.

We’ve done a lot of talking about expectations, routines, etc. We started officially dating a month ago and ever since he’s been slowly becoming more….possessive? 

Well we usually hang out Friday, Saturdays, and Sundays and if not Sundays then Thursdays. I never invite him for dinner he usually just assumes he is staying and I’ve been letting this happen. Well I’m a single mom working at a daycare. I lost food stamps. I pay over $400/month for groceries (close to $600 because of dietary needs of the boys)Plus I went a whole month recently without work. I texted him this morning saying I am taking this weekend to spend just with the kids but next weekend let’s do thurs-sat cuz we can’t do Sunday (I have plans with my daughter for her bday) and I want to start having the times be consistent and not last minute so like 1-5 or 2-5/6. That way it’s more routine for the kids (and at first I didn’t say this but it also means less food I have to cook) we don’t live together so it shouldn’t be assumed he’s staying for dinner every single time. Like at least let me invite you. 

Anyway now he’s mad at me because “you don’t want to see me at all this week and only want to see me 8 hours a week moving forward” I have appts during the week after work and barely have time to clean let alone spend time with my kids so yes I want ONE WEEKEND for my kids and yes it’s important to keep them on schedule so I want it consistent.

I have a computer degree and work for the Ministry of education in my country. This is a very poor country, and most students have very limited access to technology. I started a program to teach programming and some basic of Linux to students, and has gone well so far. Part of the program also includes creating Kiwix (offline wikipedia) labs and in some schools, creating local clouds so files wont be lost of misplaced. 

In one of the schools there is this student, a 15yo, who from the beginning has shown a lot of interest in learning. He is already doing some nice little projects, but his family is extremely poor so hi does what he can in an old Intel Atom notebook. I thought him how to use what little he can in that notebok using Linux and even upgrading to an SSD.

I have many computers, but I think my favorite one is the Raspberry Pi 400, for those who doesn't know, it's a little ARM based computer built into a keyboard form factor, unaware people just see a keyboard with an unusual amount of ports, when they realize this is a full computer, their minds are blown. This might sound silly for people in the first world, but here this is top notch tech.

So, this one student has some fascination with this Pi. He touches as if it was made of crystal when I let him use it, and together we managed to do some cool stuff.

His birthday was this month, when I knew the date of his birthday, I decided to commit a sin. Buy a full Pi400 kit from a reseller (because these are nearly impossible to buy in official retails right now) and import it. It came right on time, and gave it to him as a birthday present.

He was so excited that started crying, and his family had no idea how to thank me. It melted my heart.

Then I told this to my wife and my 8yo son, and they are mad at me. Apparently he wanted a pi for himself, just failed to communicate it, but they blasted me for giving a Pi to ""a random kid"" and when they saw the Pi arriving home, though I was gonna give it to him. They also told me that the student's family might 100% resell it since they're so poor. My son already has 3 computers, one of them a mid-budget gaming PC. He is also into software but is still too young to do more complex things. I dont know why he suddenly wanted a Pi so much. Neither of them are talking to me.

Jamie's 30th is coming up and Jamie and Kate planned a big party, and I peripherally helped out with logistics when asked. 

A few days ago, Kate texted me. She asked if I wouldn't mind ""toning down"" my look for the party, and if I could send her a picture of what I was planning to wear. I asked her what this meant and after asking several times if she ""really had to say it"" she asked if I could dress (verbatim) ""basically what \[I\] would consider frumpy"" because she really didn't want to be outshone at her own boyfriend's birthday party. When I didn't reply right away she went on to say that she wanted Jamie's full attention that night, which she wouldn't get if I showed up dressed properly.

Kate freaked out saying I was being immature by not coming just because I couldn't steal the spotlight. I said it wasn't about that, it was about her making me responsible for whether or not I draw her boyfriend's attention, which is something I've never tried to do nor done as far as I'm aware. She then said it was really important to Jamie that she stand out because his friends and colleagues would be there. I just told her that again, if she was so worried I was going to be distracting everyone, I'd rather not come than feel humiliated from now until the event. I said I would send her Jamie's gift and she could tell him why I wasn't coming. 

I guess she didn't tell him the reason because Jamie messaged me saying he knows I'm ""booked"" the night of the party but he'd really like it if I could be there, and asked if I could reorganise so I could come. I hadn't replied, but I got a message from Kate saying she knows Jamie is trying to get me to come and please could I just put my pride aside and come to the party. I asked if she was going to ditch the outfit policing, but she said no, so I said I would not be coming. She didn't reply, but I've since received a couple of texts from mutual friends saying that while her request is ridiculous, Kate is aware of that, she's just desperate to be seen a certain way and even if it's pathetic I would probably feel the same way in her shoes. Other friends I've told (who don't know Kate) say I should not bow to the pressure and that she's nuts for even asking, and I don't disagree, but also I feel bad skipping the party when it's Jamie's birthday and he asked specifically that I come.

I (25F) have been married to my husband (29F) for a few years now. He has a younger brother who recently got engaged. I have known his brother’s girlfriend for 4 years. We’re not extremely close but we hang out whenever there’s a family get together.

Anyways, for her bridal party she’s asked me to be the Maid of Honour. She has four other bridesmaids composed of cousins and old school friends. I told her that I’m very grateful that she has asked me but unfortunately I don’t have the time to do all the things expected of a MOH. I just had my first baby in November and it’s a lot. She has expressed wanting a bridal shower, bachelorette party, etc.

I told her I can just be a regular bridesmaid. She seemed fine but afterwards, my husband told me that she was venting to my brother and telling him that I’m being cold to her. According to her, she thinks I’m lying by saying I’m too busy because I’m on maternity leave and that I have “all the time in the world” and all her other friends work full time. 

My husband agrees with me but his brother called me said I should try to “be accommodating to her”. I reconsidered and told her I would be her MOH if she covers half of the responsibilities, eg planning the bachelorette party. He said he would get back to me.

The next day, she calls me and asks me why I’m being so difficult. She says I’m the only one in the bridal party not working and that I should step up. I told her again that I’m on maternity leave taking care of a baby and it is actually even more demanding than full time work. She ended the call quite upset.

You also did your do-diligence in trying to find the owners so I don't know how this one will play out AND they didn't make an official police report right away from theft.",2,0,56,56,"So over two months ago I (29M) and my girlfriend (32F) found a puppy on my front lawn.

  We searched and posted on the local lost/found pets facebook pages and visited the local vet to see if they had been reported missing and scanned for a chip. No one claimed him. 

So we kept him.  My girlfriend, our other dog and I love him. He has gotten all his vaccines and is microchipped. Vet said he was a max age of 5 months old.

Well his original owner has surfaced and reached out to us. They want him back. The puppy had gone missing along with 3 cats and another dog, when the original owner's camper that they were all living in, was stolen. 

Their original owner is demanding him back, that they miss him and have been looking for him for months.

I'm refusing to give him back. My girlfriend feels terrible about it, and thought giving him back would be the right thing to do.

"AITA for leaving my friends party after they expected their guests to pay for drinks?","NTA. They could have asked people to BYOB if they didn't want to cover the cost of drinks",1,0,6647,6647,"This past weekend my wife (41F) I (42M) attended one of my friends party's that I was invited to. For context my friend (42M) his gf (48F) and their two friends (also mid 40's M&F) were hosting this party the **4 of them together.**

A few weeks ago when I received the invitation I realized that it said on it something along the lines of ""please be prepared to purchase your own drinks"". Didn't think much of it at the time considering I just thought they were hiring a bar tender or something, but fast forward to the day of the party.

I arrive with my wife and it's my friend and his gf standing behind their kitchen counter that they were using as their ""bar"", making/charging the guests for drinks. Now I was confused for a few reasons...

1, the fact that this party was held at my friends house, it's not like this was at an event space or something where this would be normal imo. 2, there was no bar tender that they hired or anything like that. It was literally 2 of the 4 of them standing in the kitchen at a time making drinks for people and then charging them accordingly (drinks were all under $10).

Now idk if this is actually a common thing, but I have never in my 42 years of living been to a ""party"" at a friends house where the hosts are charging you themselves for drinks.

I've had multiple parties over the years, that I have invited my friend and his gf to in which they have attended, and I've never charged **ANYONE** for drinks ever. I've always bought all the drinks myself and had an open bar type of situation. Where my guests can make there own drinks. I even had a proper bar tender once and still no one was charged, it was an open bar.

I honestly felt like my friend, his gf and their friends were all trying to make a quick buck off of their guests who attended. Clearly to cover to cost of the drinks. Which yeah I understand that booze isn't cheap these days but we're talking splitting the cost of whatever they bought between **4 PEOPLE**. Like in my opinion if you can't afford to supply drinks at your party, why are you having a party in the first place?

This also wasn't for charity or anything the money made off of the drinks was for them to split.

My wife and I bought one drink each, stayed for about an hour or so, and said our goodbyes. When we were leaving my friend asked why we didn't have that much to drink? I told him because I think it's ridiculous that they are charging their close friends for drinks. He called me cheap and an unsupportive friend. I assured him that i'm not, if the charging of drinks was for a good cause (like profits go to charity or something) of course i'd buy drinks.

I told him I find the fact that they are charging for drinks, and keeping the money for themselves ridiculous and taking advantage of their friends. Anyway now my friend and his gf are butt hurt about this and have been calling me an AH to our mutual friends. AITA here?

(EDIT: Wow! I did not expect this post to blow up like this but thank you guys.

For any of those wondering, after reading these comments my wife and I have decided to exclude my ""friend"" and his gf from any of our future parties. I blocked both my ""friend"" and his gf as well.)",6647,"Putrid_Performer2509","cheapfriends-ta",0

Husband and IL’s think that there is nothing wrong with SD excluding her younger siblings from the many photos of family she has in the decor if her home. It is cruel to expect them to go where they now know they are not loved and welcome.",1,0,2874,2874,"My husband and I have three biological children together, he adopted my child from a prior relationship and I am a stepmother to his adult child. My husband was divorced from my stepdaughter's mom. She was 8 when my husband and I became serious and my son was still a baby. Not long after my stepdaughter's mom died. My husband and I had talked about marrying before she died and we delayed it for a couple of years to allow my stepdaughter time to grieve and adjust to the changes in her life. This was with the help of therapy, of course. We knew a child who lost someone so close would need extra help.

Now my stepdaughter is 20, my son is 12 and our children together are 7, 6 and 4.

So what happened here is my stepdaughter and her boyfriend recently moved into a house together. She asked for help setting up their dining room and we all went over to help her. Her house was covered in photos. The landing had them, living room, kitchen, etc. There was not a single photo of her siblings in the house, or me, but it was not seeing one of the kids that led to this. She had her parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, her cousins, and friends. But there was no sign of the kids anywhere. All of the photos with her dad were older ones, from before we met. My 12 year old, 7 and 6 year old's noticed because they were excited to look around her house. I couldn't help but notice because her boyfriend had so many of his siblings and because there were some, what felt like deliberate choices, to make sure she used photos that didn't contain her siblings. Including extended family photos from years ago with my husband's side that were taken before her dad and I met. And we know she has photos with her siblings.

I always knew she wasn't super crazy about her siblings. I always hoped as she got older she would feel love for them. But it feels like she doesn't think of them as family or as special enough to be included. The three kids who noticed were hurt. My husband tried to assure them it was likely an oversight on her part and he called her the next day to ask. She said she had only wanted photos with people she considered family and she didn't consider us family.

We were all invited to her housewarming party. But the kids did not want to go. My husband and ILs were shocked and said they had to go of course. I argued that they didn't and I told him I would stay home with them. They argued back to me that the kids needed to be. I said they did not need to be there and I wouldn't force them to go when they already feel hurt. My husband and ILs think I'm unreasonable.

It might explain the lengths at which she has gone to to support your ex SIL.",19,0,1150,1150," Last summer my brother's wife left him. He initially tried to hide the reason why but as it turns out he had been abusing her and she finally left him over his treatment of her oldest son. They have 4 children together (8M/5F/4F/0M) and she has an older son (16M). After finding out the reason for separation my sister and I no longer have a relationship with our brother. 

My dad & brother couldn't care less to have found out that their son/brother was abusing his partner and have been painting his ex the one to blame. My mom is having a hard time. My brother has always been her favorite child and although she has become a lot colder with him she still has a relationship with him. 

When SIL left my brother, it was the start of the kids summer break and she took them to stay with her dad in a different state. A month later she gave birth to her youngest child. When my mom found out the baby had been born, she was upset that SIL hadn't contacted her as she had been present for her other kids birth. When she tried to contact SIL she wouldn't answer her calls/messages. 

In august, SIL moved back to our city so the kids could return to the same schools. Her and my brother have also sorted out custody/child support and my brother is only allowed a few hours of supervised visitation a week. Since then, my mom has been smothering SIL. It comes from a good place; she feels guilty about what her son did and wants to support SIL. She has been going to all the kids’ events/sports games, taking them out regularly, spoiling them with gifts (I think she spent close to $1000 on the 16 yr olds birthday), and has been inviting herself over to SILs house a lot. 

I know SIL is grateful for the help I think she finds my mom's presence a bit much. She recently told my mom (while I was present) that she didn't want to see her until spring break and that afterwards they would sit down and create some boundaries in their relationship and her relationship with the kids. My mom was very upset and called my SIL ungrateful for everything she had done for her and that she would struggle as a single mom without her help. They argued for a while before my mom and I left. In the car my mom tried to get me on her side, but I told her I agreed with SIL and that she had been smothering her and the kids too much and they needed space. 

A few days ago, my mom and I got into an argument about it again. My mom tried to defend herself by saying something along the lines of ""it's not my fault \[brother\] abused her"" to which I responded that she did hold some blame as she was the one who raised him and arguably helped program his sense of arrogance by favoring him. My mom is now angry at me that I would take SIL's side and overreacting about what I said. Even my sister thinks I'm in the wrong. AITA?",1150,"PermissionLucky1992","yesterdayaccurate535",0
"AITA for not sharing my inheritance?","NTA Guilt is the fuel for assholes. A isn't your problem. B is free to make A her problem but not free to make her your problem. Follow your brother's example and cut 'em off.",1,0,2624,2624,"I (25F) recently lost my mother to cancer. Me and my brother (35M) are her only children. For the past 7 years, I’ve been staying in an apartment my mother bought. She always told me that when she died, she wanted me to have it because she worked so hard to ensure  I always had somewhere to live. So when she died, she left me the apartment in the will. My brother has no issue with this, he makes more than enough of his own money and actually owns an apartment in the same building. 

However, my aunts (A and B) have an issue with this. A has had money issues for as long as I’ve known her and my mother was always helping her out with money when she was alive. B is financially stable, but in no position to help A. They both think that since I make enough money to be able to rent a place, I should let A stay in the apartment and rent my own because that’s what my mother would have wanted. 

I said no, stating that my mother wanted me to have a place of my own. I am currently saving all the money I would have used on rent and intend to buy my own house when I have enough saved. 

When I said no, they then suggested that I should share some of the money my mother left me with them. She had two life insurance policies, both of which went only to my brother and I. She also left us the house and her car. Basically, everything was split between my brother and I and no one else got anything. My aunts feel that this was wrong and that they, especially A, deserve some of the money. 

My brother blocked them all on platforms when they asked this of him and suggests I do the same, but I feel guilty about cutting off my family. 

But I also feel strongly that if my mother wanted them to get money, she would have left them something. But she didn’t. She chose to leave EVERYTHING to my brother and I. My aunts are saying that my mother did that because she assumed we would share. But I knew my mother. She would have told me if she wanted me to do that. All she said was that she wanted to die knowing that me and my brother would be able to support ourselves.

NOPE!",3,0,900,900,"A family friend was getting married nearby to me, so my sister asked if she and my nephews could stay with me because hotel rooms in the area are expensive. The house I am currently living in I bought a few months ago. I barely have any furniture in it and don't plan on buying anymore for a while because I plan on renovating and don't want it in the way. The only things to sleep on is my bed and a couch.

 I told my sister that. She said it was okay and that she would bring an air mattress for her sons to sleep on and she would sleep on the couch. I also told her that the couch was really small (loveseat sized) and uncomfortable. She said it would be fine for one night. I also told her to bring their own bedding because I really don't have much aside from what I use.

The night of the wedding my sister's son's are tired so they leave the reception early around 9pm. I wanted to stay longer so I told her would get a ride home from someone else and gave her the keys to my house.

When I get home around midnight my sister is watching tv in the living room. Her son's aren't there. She explains to me that her air mattress wouldn't inflate. so she put her son's in my bed and said since my bed is big enough she could share with them and I could sleep on the couch.

I said that wasn't happening. The couch is way to uncomfortable to sleep on and way too short for me. I would be hanging off the end. I already have enough trouble sleeping and I had stuff I needed to do the next day. I tried to get the air mattress the work, but it wouldn't turn on. So I got my spare blanket and set it up on the floor along with a sleeping bag. My sister reluctantly got the boys up and off my bed. Once they were all in their spots I went to bed and quickly fell asleep.

The next morning my sister was in a really bad mood. They all didn't sleep the whole night because the blankets I set up on the ground weren't thick enough and it was uncomfortable. My sister tried sleeping on the floor, but her son's fought about sleeping on the couch because there wasn't room enough for the both of them. My sister said I could have at least checked up on them or let the boys sleep in my bed with me, but to me that's really weird and I would not have been comfortable with that.

My daughter (10) wanted a puppy for her birthday so my wife and I went to a shelter and picked a puppy for her, we made it very clear that she had to be responsible for it. That means that she'll have to clean after him, feed him and checking his water bowl, etc. We would hire a trainer and would take him to the vet when it was needed, but besides that she had to take care of it. 

During the first month things were okay, she did as she promised. But now (over two months since she got the puppy) she complains about having to clean when the dog poops or pees on the floor and when she had to take care of him. This week she reached the last straw because she forgot to give him water, my wife had to fill his bowl because she didn't do it. 

I told her this is enough because a dog is not a toy and she promised to be responsible. I contacted some friends/ family and asked them if they wanted the puppy. Finally a coworker said she wanted it and I took him to her house. 

My daughter is very sad now but I think she needs to learn a lesson here. My parents told me I was being unfair because deep down I knew that my daughter was gonna fail in being responsible and I set her up for failure.

If I go to the bedroom to have a minute to myself, they are yelling up to me within 5 minutes to see if I'm good. If I say I need to go for a walk to clear my head, they follow me and make it a family thing. If I want to go site see they immediately get ready to go too and coerce us to go to the sites they think I will enjoy, versus what I would actually like. They sit there and talk to me and won't let me go to bed until after midnight and then they are up knocking on the door at 6am to get me and my fiance downstairs for coffee.

I'm an introvert. I need space to refill my social bar and since I've been here, I haven't had a moment to myself. I mean not even being able to take a shower without being harassed is pissing me the fuck off. I've talked to my fiance about it several times and have told him more than once I need ""me time"".

Not helping at all. I've told him that. But after being followed when I was on the phone and having his mother try talking over the conversation I was having, it was the final straw.

Also regardless of the situation NOBODY scolds my child but me and her dad, if you have an issue you talk to the parent for them to address",29,0,510,510,"Recently, we had a birthday party for my (32f) son (7m) He invited some of his classmates and our neighbour's kids who he's close with. One of them was a 12-year-old boy who brought a doll-type thing which glowed and made noises if you pressed a button. We opened the present later after the party, and even though my son was happy to receive it, I noticed that the toy had a cracked shoulder.

The next day, when the boy came to play with my son and the other kids, I asked him who brought the gift, and he said he did it. I showed him the broken part and lightly scolded him. I simply told him that if he was going to spend money buying something, he should've checked the thing. I gave it back to him and told him to ask the store to replace it since it's broken. I thought it was a good life lesson and that he'd remember this. It would help him when he buys something later on. It would teach him not to waste his money.

However, later that evening his mom called me and told me that I was very rude to her son. She said and I quote ""if someone gives you a gift, you just appreciate it and don't say anything even if it's not that good, especially when it's a kid"" Turns out, he bought it with his own pocket money, and he put a lot of thought into it.

Nigel was a widower of three years when he met my sister. His kids at the time of them meeting were 6f and 8m. Nigel's late wife's family was around a lot. My sister hated it. From the very early days it was clear she was toxically jealous of Nigel's late wife and the kids mom. She talked about how strange it was the kids, who didn't remember her, had her photo in their bedrooms, how her stepdaughter had a locket with a photo of her mom, dad and brother in it. I remember back then asking how it was strange. Her mom was loved and Nigel and his late wife's family likely didn't want the kids to not know they were loved by their mom. She said that was her job now. I told her it wasn't healthy to feel that jealous and put out over a mom being remembered. Think of how she would feel if our mom died.

Honestly, I had a lot of respect for Nigel for the first two or three years because his kids seemed to be his priority and he seemed to still love and care about his late wife and not want to erase her but was also ready to be married to someone else. I had seen a lot of far more awful scenarios. But then he started letting my sister push herself onto the kids and try to force out their maternal relatives. It was very clear my sister blamed the maternal relatives for neither of her stepkids coming to think of her as their mom. She didn't want to hear any other reason it could be.

Now both of her stepkids are adults and her stepson became a father for the first time in January. His daughter is named after both her grandmother's. But his mom's name is her first name. My sister was so unhappy about that. She told him it was disrespectful to her and all that crap. He told her to go fuck herself and told her she still hadn't figured out that she wasn't his mom, she wasn't his parent, she wasn't even his real family, because he would happily dump her out of his life for good and would never feel bad about that.

My sister bitched for weeks about it and then I told her if I was her stepkid, I'd do the same. That she had no respect for his mom and had no respect for his maternal family. She freaked out and told me that was a shitty thing to say and I should be on HER side, because she's my SISTER.

"TIL The famous musician Sir Paul McCartney can neither read or write music","I'm comfortable with both methods of music - reading music or playing by ear. I learned to play guitar by ear and I think it's a very important part of musical training that develops your musical instincts, improvisation skills and spontaneity in a way that learning with written notation doesn't. But later, I learned how to sight read and it opened up a whole new world of things like Bach fugues that gave my fingers a taste of ""properly composed"" music, developed my playing style loads and opened hundreds of new doors. Now, I'm comfortable playing entirely by ear (I don't even think about note names or the names of the complex chords my fingers form on the spot) or playing with written music in which I can musically analyze anything I'm doing at a given time. It all feels very musically liberating and I'm glad I didn't stick with one over the other. 

I think a lot of people who learn formally with sheet music miss out on developing a load of musical skills that come from playing by ear. I remember taking a basic music theory class at one point and the teacher was a 60 year old woman who said that she had never once in her life tried to improvise. She could only play written music.

When someone keeps on venting you are allowed to express the opinion even if it wasn't asked. Also instead of forgiveness, consider change the friend itself. What kind of person wishes for a misfortune that too with this intensity.

Be selfish when it comes to your valid feelings. Breaking of a group is not your concern right now.",1,0,59,59,"I'm (21F), and my roommate (22F) told me she misses her ex, and it pisses her off to know that he is happy and thriving. 

She has said stuff like this before and admitted that it is toxic, yet she wished that her ex always misses her and gets sad and that he finds a girl and gets happy but reminisces and feels that he was happier with my roommate and that she was the better choice. I have always understood where she came from. She has messed up with a friend in the past, and I never said she was being toxic with that behavior towards him (because I hate confrontation and sharing my opinions about other people's lives and didn't think it was my place). But anyway, later, I told her that she was being toxic with him when she asked for my opinion. Anyway, the point of this paragraph is that we often tell the truth to each other about our actions, when the other person is being toxic etc.

So, anyway, she told me again that she's angry to hear that her ex is thriving (despite telling me a few days ago that she has moved on), and I told her that it's toxic because she's upset by his progress (because from my past experiences with her and general knowledge, that is what people mean when they say that their ex's happiness is pissing them off), which could or could not be because of her absence in his life.

She explained that that was not what she meant and that she was angry because she was not with him (her ex) to tell him how proud she was of him. I apologized for misinterpreting her words, and she cursed me by saying, ""I hope you suffer the greatest and worst misfortune possible in this whole world"".

It broke my heart to hear that line because I don't have the best life either, and I suffer in my own ways, but unlike her, I choose not to be so vocal about it all the time (she is popular among our friend group to complain about petty things every 5 minutes). Moreover, I wouldn't even think of something like that for my worst enemy. I never have, and I still never will.

It's been a few hours since that happened, and I cannot get it out of my mind. On one hand, I don't feel like forgiving her and talking to her ever again, and returning everything she ever gave to me. On the other, I feel like it'd break our entire friend group, and I'd lose a friend over something that could be petty from a third-person POV, as I might be overthinking because of my anger.

I admit that my viewpoint could be biased, so some of our mutual friends talked to her about it, and according to her, my tone was bitchy. However, I still don't think I deserved to be cursed like that.

A little background: This lady is a repeat offender-she loves to sit on a machine-not use it- and chat with people…once the conversation is done she’ll eventually start her workout (the number of times I’ve waited for her on the leg abductor and leg press while she chatted away not using the machine…I digress…back to the story).

I saw a timid girl (probably late teens early 20s) shyly/very politely ask the lady if she could work in-the lady said no, that she hadn’t used it yet. The girl walked away, looking embarrassed.

I got hot. 

I called out to the lady and said with very clear irritation “excuse me, ma’am, hey. It’s  very busy right now. I’ve watched you sit on this machine for at least the last 5 minutes chatting to your buddy without doing a single rep. If you’re not going to use it, it’s f*****d up to not let someone else in.”

From what I understand, they made that deal because the girl didn't want to abort but also didn't want to take care of the kid, and my friend's family didn't want the baby to go into adoption. They ""punished him"" by making him take care of the baby by himself. They helped him financially until he finished high school, but the parenting job was supposed to be done by him alone.

So, since I'm the one who knows about computers, my family sees me as their personal tech support. And my family is B.I.G. I live with my mom, my little brother, 2 of my aunts and their kids. The kids are lazy when it comes to tech shit because they know I'll do it for them, but my mom and aunts are beyond tech illiterate, they're tech morons.

I am constantly interrupted in my studies or word because my cousins forgot their Disney Plus profile pin, or my mom needs to reset her email password again, I actually set up a cloud password manager for them that they do not use because they always forget that it is an option. 

So a few weeks ago, one of my little cousins wanted me to help him reset a password after he got locked out of Google, and he aggressively knocked on my door demanding that I help him.  I asked him, ""Do I look like TS to you?"" and he said yes with a straight face.

So I got a domain and set up a help desk. Then I told my family that if they wanted any help from me, they should go to the website and submit a ticket for my help. My aunt said I was being ridiculous, but I was deadly serious.

In the following days, I would give them the cold shoulder if they tried to come to me with technical problems, and just tell them to submit a ticket and I would send them the solution by mail. Forgot your mail password? Too bad, use someone else's mail. Fortnite is lagging? Get a ticket and wait till I'm home. That helped me a lot.

But then yesterday I came back from the university and the whole house was sitting in the living room telling me to sit down. They were doing an INTERVENTION on me! WTF!? They said I was rude, cold, condescending, and unhelpful. My mom said she's tolerated my ""manly ways"" (no idea where that comes from) because I'm helpful with technology, but now they won't stand up to my disrespect and I'm treating them like children. I said no, I'm treating them like customers.

The discussion got heated and turned into a screaming match. I said I would move in with my ex-stepfather because he doesn't ask me to do shit, I'm still with my family but I feel like everyone hates me now, but my ex step father says I'm on my right to be annoyed by them.

"AITA For thinking my MIL’s obsession with my son is absurd!?","NTA. Except maybe for repeatedly caving to her guilt trips (which can be hard not to do, I understand) .  Moving forward though: Limit visits, none unsupervised. She is too much of a loose canon to be trusted alone with a child. Good luck!",1,0,4899,4899,"I have a 4 yr old and I am due with baby #2 mid year. My husband (27) and I (25) have been together since we were teens. MIL (47) was jealous from the get go of our relationship. I’ve read up a bit on this, it’s to do with her not having their emotional needs met by a partner so they subconsciously use their son to meet those needs. 

Then when I fell pregnant with my now 4 yr old, she kept saying “my baby” and sometimes she would slip and start referring to hubby as our child’s “brother”. This continued my whole pregnancy and she would boast about it to anyone and everyone. Then when he was born it all amplified. She wanted to take him to spend alone time with him from the time he was a couple weeks old. And would be offended when we said no. She would always say that grandma loves him more than his parents do. She would kick up a giant stink whenever she wasn’t able to take him out alone, She never wanted to spend time with him around us. 

there were so many times where we tried to set boundaries but she would always do it her way and guilt trip us. When we would do things together she would physically push the pram out of my hands and she would push the pram EVERYWHERE anytime we were together “I’ll push my baby” and I was never allowed. she would never correct people if they assumed she was his mother. And as his parents we thought that was too weird. he is always “her grandson” but never ever is he our son. anytime we do anything it is ALWAYS about her. It’s like shes now using my son to meet her emotional needs which even though it’s subconscious, to me it’s SICK! I have tried to place more boundaries but always get met with guilt trips. 

when we go places together where my son will experience what I call “firsts” all of those things are taken over by her. Even just small details like going to buy a drink, she NEEDS to take him instead of us. she either takes him and does them without us or I’ll say hey maybe he could do that with his parents too and she will be unhappy and making sure that he holds HER HAND and he’s sitting next to her and not us, she always always makes sure if he comes over to me that she gets his attention back onto her. She constantly constantly tells him she loves him the most, he’s her favourite, he’s her favourite person, and any time we do anything together to make her the centre of his attention. 

now that I’m having another baby (also a boy) I have been worried it’ll be the same thing all over again. But it’s not. I caught her telling my son (don’t worry you will be grandmas favourite always you are grandmas boy you won’t have to share I’ll always be your favourite person) and that is just horrible. She is saying things like “you and grandma can do things together and mum and dad can have the new baby”. 

am I the asshole for thinking that this is just absurd behaviour!?

EDIT- We have had many talks.. me alone with her, him alone with her, us together with her, it always ends with her crying and guilt tripping us

EDIT 2- I understand it now after reading comments, sometimes it hard to look in from the outside when you are stuck on the inside. For a while there I thought taking her away may have been a bad decision because of how much he adores her. In my mind I was taking away someone he cherished. After reading the comments I can now see what it is from the outside looking in, just needed that boost to get there and get out of the box. The guilt I was feeling was mainly because of how he feels towards her, which now I get. How could a 4 year old not cherish someone who gives into his every whim? I get that now that’s actually manipulation but when you stand here and watch them and you watch how his eyes light up when she’s around and how excited he is, it does take a little bit of a shove to look at it from a different angle and have that realisation moment",4899,"VariousTry4624","One_hell_of_a_lifeee",0
"AITA for increasing a family members rent","Compromise: you two agree that family members will pay 75 percent of the market rate for rent. That way, you all are offering family a meaningful discount, and you are still making some income for yourselves. 

Doing this would also allow for periodic raises in rent, when the market rate increases.",2,0,569,569,"My (f28 ) husbands (m32) cousin (m36) has lived in our basement suite for a few years and we have always cut him a deal on rent. Last spring we moved to a new house and he came with us renting our 2 bedroom basement suite for $1150 (no contract). For reference a suite this new and large are going for $2000+ in our area. Prior to this he was living in the 1 basement suite of our previous house, for $800 (we rented it out for $1300 as soon as he moved out with us). 

My husband wants to charge him so little because “hes family and he can’t afford more” However, since the cousin has lived with us these past few years he only works for the summer months and some of the fall months. Prob a total of 4-5 months of the year and goes on EI for the rest of the year without trying to look for a job. I understand he is family but this kind of bothers me as he is a 36 yo man that does not feel like working and we’re losing out on large rental income that could help with our bills. We are not well off by any means. We work very hard and have middle class jobs. 

Another thing that bothers me is that my husband and I maintain our big beautiful yard and the cousin has even made comments to me how he is not responsible for helping with yard work (even though he spends a lot of time outside enjoying that yard and I also never even asked him to help with yard work). You’d think for such a discounted rate he’d be willing to help out a bit (again we’ve never asked this of him). He also made statements to me in the past how he “pays the mortgage” for us. Which is not nearly true. 

Additionally, now my younger sister (f21) got a job offer in our city and we coincidentally we will have that previous $1300 basement suite for rent. I want to help her out by renting it cheaper. However, financially we can’t offer much of a discounted rental rate mostly due to my husbands cousin pretty much getting a $1000 dollar discount on rent each month. 

I don’t want my little sister renting out a 1 bedroom $1300 suite while his 36 yo adult cousin rents out a huge 2 bedroom $1050 basement suite. Even if my sister doesn’t move here I want to increase his rent. So AITA if I want to increase his rent by maybe like $200 each month? (Again there’s no contract). Wondering what everyone’s thoughts are on this.

To add: 

1. The cousin is family to me and I do like him. I don’t have anything personally against him. He is like a brother to my husband. But this is besides the fact that I feel like this is not financially responsible for various reasons. 

2. I have brought this up to my husband a few times and it turns into a fight and he refuses to see my perspective and sees the increasing rent as a monstrous, selfish, greedy thing to do. So this is why I wanted to see others opinions on if I am in fact a delusional asshole or not.",569,"coyote701","ChinchillaSushi",0

She made absolutely no effort to sound kind when she, in an extremely rude and annoyed tone, told me to stop packing my son such “disgusting and inappropriate” lunches. I felt absolutely appalled when she said this, as me and the teacher have, up until now, always maintained a very friendly relationship. She added that the lunches I’m packing my son are “very distracting for the other students and have an unpleasant odor.” I told her that I understand her concerns, as the lunches I pack are definitely not the healthiest, but the lunches are according to my son’s preferences. 

The usual lunch that I send him to school with is small celery sticks with blue cheese and goat cheese, kimchi and spam (we are Korean and he absolutely adores this dish), and spicy Doritos marinated in Sriracha (I know, I know, but he deserves a snack, and I don’t put that many chips in the baggy.) 

I ended the call by saying that I very much appreciated her worries, but that at the end of the day, I am not going to drastically change my sons’ lunches all of a sudden, and that it’s not my fault if other students are “distracted” by his meal. It is very important to me what my son enjoys, and I want him to like my lunches. 

The teacher sent an Email to me an hour ago saying that my response was “unacceptable” and that his lunches are “just too inappropriate to be sent to school any longer.” I haven’t responded yet and don’t want to.

Yes, grandma may fall into her grave and try to preform an exorcism on you if she found out the truth. 
But at the end of the day, tip toeing around the truth makes life complicated for no reason.  
You don't owe granny an apology, and dad needs to be the one speaking up for you if he wants to avoid these uncomfortable situations.",2,0,6,6,"So I'm (17F) in high school and I'm bisexual and agnostic. My family is very religious, and though my parents support LGBTQ+ people and the community they grew up in households with very strict parents, and thus are incredibly loyal to their parents. I'm not the same way - I speak my mind if and when I want to - and this detail is one of the most important aspects of the story.

It's also important to know that I hate hugging. Sometimes, if I'm in the mood, I'll let my friends or younger cousins hug me, but I hate hugging adults because as a kid, grown adults pulled me into hugs at church all the time and I grew to dislike it immensely. I constantly say how much I hate hugging people, but my family tries to force hugs on me all the time, even when I say I'm uncomfortable. They think it's funny when I shove them off me or they try to guilt-trip me by using the family card, especially my parents, who say they can touch/hug me whenever they want because they're my parents.

Tonight, my grandmother made us all have prayer. I felt awkward because I'm agnostic and my grandma would throw a fit if she found out, but my dad made me join anyway. She rambled on about how we need God in our schools and how school shootings, electronics, and LGBTQ+ people are bad for students, which I kind of rolled my eyes to. My dad asked us to name one thing that God had given us that we're grateful for, and I got so stuck on the word ""God"" that I couldn't answer the question. It's stupid, but I froze. My grandma ripped into me, bringing up my illness and how God did this and that for me. I answered sarcastically because I didn't know what to say, but my dad was annoyed with me.

Then, we said an ending prayer and everyone hugged. My grandma beelined straight for me. I tried to sidestep her, but she blocked me and made me hug her. It was an awkward hug; at first I tried to give her a side hug, but she made me wrap both arms around her. It was extremely uncomfortable, but I thought that was that.

However, my dad pulled me aside. He said that I had to apologize to my grandmother and give her a ""real"" hug to show her that I'm sorry. I agreed to apologize, but I didn't want to hug her because, as I said, I *hate* hugging people. He kept saying ""I get it, I get it, but we all have things that we don't want to do"" and, frustrated, I yelled at him because it seemed like he *didn't* understand what the problem was - the fact that I don't care for physical affection and that I'm uncomfortable to express beliefs in things I don't necessarily believe in - even though he kept saying he *did* understand it.

She already made me hug her once, so I don't understand why I have to do it again.

I have a lot of respect for my parents since they're hardworking, but this pissed me off and I may be the asshole for yelling at my father and storming off. Maybe I should've tried to act less uncomfortable. I just would like some clarity to figure out who's in the wrong here so I can mitigate the situation.",6,"MembershipJaded5215","utterstupiditee",0

I was invited to my friend's gf's house to celebrate her son's birthday. Everything was going great. My gf never really spent time with my friends because she says I act differently i.e., drink more, loud, not present, obnoxious (her words) so I was happy she agreed to go. I went to the restroom for a few minutes and when I came back everything seemed fine. On the car ride home, she mentioned how the topic of my ex's pregnancy came up (not mine) between the host and some other people. My ex is still mutual friends with my friends however I am NC due to a message she sent me once she found out I had moved on.  The conversation must have taken up at most 3 minutes when I was gone.  Now here comes the issue.

My friends from Florida are coming back to our state for the weekend of spring break and wanted to hang out. They will be in a town 5 hours away from us and we agreed to meet them there and get an airbnb. I invited my gf and she made me believe she'd think about going but then told me no and made plans to go visit her family instead who live in another state. She has the entire week off while I only have the weekend. We fought about me going on the trip because the person who brought up my exes pregnancy will be there and she believes that was her effort to sabotage our relationship because she still is friend's with my ex and sees it as her helping her out. I disagree. I feel like it was just a slip of the tongue. When you're not used to censoring yourself and all of a sudden someone new is there sometimes you accidentally talk about things that come off as insensitive to the other person. I told my bud when I first found out about the conversation in November and he did say it accidentally came up and wasn't meant as an attack on my relationship or my gf and he apologized. I told my gf this and she refuses to believe that it was anything other then his gf trying to break us up. We have fought about it every week since February. I got tired of the fighting and her saying if I go I'm choosing my others over her so I said I wouldn't go. This past weekend she said she wants me to go and have fun and she was sorry. But now she changed her mind again and said if I go she can't trust me because it's betraying her and shows I value other people over her. I just want to go to spend time with my friends who are from out of state and I may not see again for a long time. All efforts for me to conflict resolve by suggesting I arrange a sit down with her and my bud's gf have been rejected. She even told me I'm not allowed to tell them that there is even an issue. She knows how important my friends are to me and her refusing to even attempt to conflict resolve has caused alot of stress in my life especially with her constant back and forth on the matter.

It obviously destroyed her and she stopped seeking help. I'm not saying I blame her because that shits scary and fucked up but idk. Idk what I expect honestly.

So as of like 4 months ago things started getting bad. Like.. things started making her incredibly uncomfortable.

Anyways, she won't leave the house now. I asked her to come help me with laundry (laundromat) and she got pissed. Said that she shouldn't have to help me with my chore. I wasn't asking her to come for help. I want her to get out of that damn house. I told her that and she immediately doubled down and said ""Really? You want me to get out of the house but the only time you ask is if it's to fucking grocery shop or do laundry so clearly it's because you want to pawn your chores off on me despite all the other shit I do.""

Now to the family part. He and his family have always been close whereas my family wasn't always the best and we had a falling out for about a year and just regained contact about 9months ago and things are going good so far and I'm happy. My boyfriend however keeps saying that his family is better than mine and gets upset when I defend my family because he feels they don't deserve it. He said he worries about our future children being around them (I'm not even pregnant) and said they don't compare to his family. He has only met my patents once for a few hours and they were nothing but kind to him.

"AITA for sabotaging my SIL during a competition?","NTA. Who does that?? She seems like a fun addition….",1,0,1101,1101,"Okay so she called it sabotage, I don’t think I did anything wrong but that’s why it’s up to you fine folks to decide.

SIL is Sophie, she’s 26F and married to my husband’s brother. I’m 29F.

Sophie has been married to my BIL since late 2021. Whenever we have had holidays she has spent it with her family, and my husband and I only go back to his hometown during the holidays - so I don’t know her well.

Anyway we have a holiday coming up in just over a month. For the first time Sophie’s parents will be away so she will be celebrating with us.

That’s all background. As is the fact that my MIL is a trained patissier. I promise it’s relevant.

I happened to be in town this week and MIL started putting together her list of ingredients for the stuff she will make. She was consulting me, and my husband’s sister Zara, about what to make and also delegated a couple of things to each of us.

Sophie came into the living room and said “oh I can definitely make better brownies, tartlets and whatever else than [my name]!”

Now my MIL takes desserts very seriously. I said okay you can make that stuff but MIL said no we need to have the nicest sweets. There was a back and forth and Sophie suggested what I can only describe as a bake off.

So we made brownies, tiramisu, lemon meringue and the family judged between us and everyone voted in my favour. 

Sophie got mad at me and said I’d hidden the fact that I know how to bake from her to which Zara said neither of us really bake when MIL is around because she’s amazing but that we both *can* if we need to.

Now Sophie is mad at me for both hiding my ability from her and for purposefully embarrassing her in front of our in laws. I think she’s stupid - she wanted the silly bake off right up until she lost, it’s not my fault she has an ego

",1,0,1110,1110,"My (29F) best friend (27F) is getting married in a few months, and she recently told me that she found the perfect wedding dress. The only problem is that it costs $5,000, which is way more than she had budgeted for. She's asked me if I would be willing to contribute $1,000 towards the dress, as an early wedding gift, since I'm her maid of honor and we've been friends for over a decade.

While I'm happy to support my friend on her wedding day, I just can't justify spending that much money on a dress that she'll only wear once. I've already spent a lot of money on the bachelorette party, bridal shower, and other wedding-related expenses, and I'm not sure I can afford to add another $1,000 to the tab.

My friend is a little bit of a bridezilla, and she's been very focused on having the ""perfect"" wedding. I'm worried that if I don't contribute to the dress, she'll be upset with me and it could put a strain on our friendship. On the other hand, I don't want to compromise my own financial stability just to please her.

"AITA for suggesting my stepson (16M) moves out?","YTA What happened with your SDs came about organically. Sounds like they figured it out themselves and so they're both happy. What you're doing/have done is because you feel it's unfair that your son doesn't have his 'own room'. That's not your stepson's fault and not his job/responsibility to fix. You can pretty it all up with word salad to make it seem like you're looking out for everyone but you said it yourself. 'It's unfair that all the older kids but my son have their own rooms at one of their parents house.' 

Oh and look! That would also probably get rid of that close bond that your husband and his oldest son have at the same time! Woohoo!!! Two birds and all that. ",80,0,2864,2864,"My husband and I have 6 children total and live in 4 bedroom house. We have two sons together (8 & 6), I have a son from a previous relationship (15), and I have 3 step children (20F, 16M & 16F). We live in a 4 bedroom house and for most the time we lived there we had 2 kids per room with the youngest boys sharing, the older boys sharing and the girls sharing. 

Things changed a couple years ago. My oldest stepdaughter finished school and is attending university locally. The girls decided at this point that instead of sharing a bedroom at their dads and sharing a bedroom at their mums, they would each take 1 room as their permanent bedroom. So the 16 yr old lives with us full time and the 20 yr old lives with her mum full time. They both visit the other parents house regularly. 

My 16 yr old stepson has his own bedroom at his mum's house but still splits time between each parents house mostly 50/50. My son lives full time with us as he doesn't have much of a relationship with his dad. My son and stepson do not get on that well and they can often be heard screaming at each other in their bedroom. 

Recently, I asked my stepson why he doesn't move to live full time with his mum so he and my son can have a similar arrangement as their sisters. This way both of the boys would have their own rooms. He would obviously still visit like his older sister does and we could figure something out like a futon instead of a bed in their room so my son has more space when stepson's not there. 

My stepson overreacted to my suggestion and is trying to make out like I'm kicking him out, when really I'm just thinking of a better use of space. It's unfair that all the older kids but my son have their own rooms at one of their parents house. My son likes the idea and has brought it up to his stepbrother a few more times since I originally suggested it and it has caused arguments between them. He now seems to be considering it. 

My husband is angry with me for suggesting his son moving permanently to his mums. He thinks that he and his son would have a less close relationship if this happens (my husband favours his oldest son over our boys). He also thinks I'm making his son feel like he's being forced out. However, it was his daughters already doing the same thing that gave me the idea because it worked out well for them and they both seem happier. I'm also not forcing this to happen I was just suggesting it to him, it would be completely up to him. Is this a good plan or AITA for bringing it up?",2864,"rbrancher2","brgtail1735",1
