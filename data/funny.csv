"Going forward, comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays.","If people find the content funny, it gets voted to the top. Isn't that how this subreddit works? 

As a comic creator, I take offense to you labeling our work as ""low-effort"" and ""poorly made"", or saying our jokes are ""stolen"". You are directly hurting artists with these irresponsible, biased labels

This work takes a lot of time and energy (and abuse) and its provided at **no charge!** You're free to downvote it and move on if it doesn't suit your tastes but you don't get to police what others enjoy, and shame on you for doing just that. Clearly this sub isn't for humor, it's for whatever the mods deem funny based on their own specific tastes.

You could at least mention r/comics or r/webcomics to help drive traffic there, or redirect the users to that subreddit. Feels like that would solve a lot of things.",399,0,1589,1589,"Hey there, folks!

As you're probably aware, there are quite a few very talented, very funny artists who offer their comics in /r/Funny... but there are also a growing number of ""comics"" here that are little more than low-effort ways of bypassing Rule 9. Moreover, subscribers have been expressing their concerns¹ that comics (of both varieties) almost always eclipse every other variety of content offered here.

Basically, on any given day, a poorly made comic featuring a stolen joke has a much better chance of being seen than something well-produced and original. Some of this is the fault of the ""Ennui Engine,"" but it's also the result of there being *so many* comics posted in /r/Funny.

To address this, we're going to experiment with a new approach:

Going forward, comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays PDT (Pacific Daylight Time), and only by the people creating them.²

Our hopes with this are is twofold: 

1. By limiting ""comic days"" to two days a week, other original content will get the chance that it deserves. 

2. Wednesdays and Sundays will come to highlight – with the help of discerning voters, of course – the best comics submitted to the subreddit.³

Moreover, subscribers have been expressing their concerns¹ that comics (of both varieties) almost always eclipse every other variety of content offered here.

Basically, on any given day, a poorly made comic featuring a stolen joke has a much better chance of being seen than something well-produced and original. Some of this is the fault of the ""Ennui Engine,"" but it's also the result of there being *so many* comics posted in /r/Funny.

To address this, we're going to experiment with a new approach:

Going forward, comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays PDT (Pacific Daylight Time), and only by the people creating them.²

Our hopes with this are is twofold: 

1. By limiting ""comic days"" to two days a week, other original content will get the chance that it deserves. 

2. Wednesdays and Sundays will come to highlight – with the help of discerning voters, of course – the best comics submitted to the subreddit.³ 

Those of you who have had nothing better to do than [read our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules) and stay up to date on all of our announcements will know that we aren't *really* changing much, but even so, we wanted to mention the update, explain the reasons behind it, and give folks the chance to discuss⁴ everything.

We'll be trialing this over the next few weeks, and we may end up adjusting things⁵ slightly.

"Going forward, comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays.","I have a funny story related to suicide. 3 years ago, when I was in the 7th grade, I had a fucking day. I wrote a math test for 2 that day, I came home and my parents yelled at me harshly, in addition to school, I worked part-time and was very tired. Then I felt fucked up and lonely, even though I was a big wide kid, I sat on the roof of our house and cried a lot, at that moment I thought my heart would just burst, it hurt a lot. I sat on the roof for a long time, but then when everyone was asleep I decided to suicide. I thought: Nothing will stop me, God himself wants me to do it. I had already hung the rope on the very last step of the stairs, made a loop and was about to leave for another world, but it turns out my older brother was ""calming"" himself that night and did not sleep, through the window he saw me hanging on the stairs without signs of life and how he screamed: What the fuck are you doing? Go to bed, you little fucker. I heard it already from the other world and was very scared, from which I woke up and changed my mind",2,0,1589,1589,"Hey there, folks!

As you're probably aware, there are quite a few very talented, very funny artists who offer their comics in /r/Funny... but there are also a growing number of ""comics"" here that are little more than low-effort ways of bypassing Rule 9. Moreover, subscribers have been expressing their concerns¹ that comics (of both varieties) almost always eclipse every other variety of content offered here.

Basically, on any given day, a poorly made comic featuring a stolen joke has a much better chance of being seen than something well-produced and original. Some of this is the fault of the ""Ennui Engine,"" but it's also the result of there being *so many* comics posted in /r/Funny.

Neighborhood Watch,"The vigilantes can be a very useful resource but…
how much time could pass before this person begins to think that the laws (which, implicitly, he already considers ineffective, given the choice he has made) begin to stay close to him... because they prevent him from defending the neighborhood (only that for now) however, how do you deem it appropriate and do you begin to move more or less ""outside"" the law?
By becoming judge and jury himself?
There will surely be comments like: ""but he is a harmless character, who tries his best to make the place where he lives safer""...
But what do we know about his mental conditions and what these may or may not generate?
In short ... all this to say that ideally it is something understandable and also useful but, given the possible consequences that this behavior could have, it would be better if all this did not happen.
Sometimes it's too late to cry...

This is my personal thought.

Thank you.

Number and lettering tiny ducks to hide in my friends homes.,"I used to work at a restaurant with a GM who would hide little dinosaurs everywhere. She’d label them, and have bounties for them (free meals, “get out of rolling silverware” coupons, “pick your section” coupons, gift cards she’d traded with area restsurants, and sometimes actual cash.)

The catch was that they’d be hidden in places that needed to be deep cleaned, so if you turned in a dinosaur, she’d check to see if you’d cleaned it well before giving you the reward.

It was a fun way to get everyone to do the unpleasant jobs, and it gave people something to do during downtime that actually had a reward.

She was a great boss.",226,0,706,706,,706,BangkokPadang,FjohursLykkewe,0
Number and lettering tiny ducks to hide in my friends homes.,"I travel a lot, and my wife loves to hide surprises in my luggage and other travel stuff.

At the beginning of 2022, she bought a 200ct. pack of these duckies, and stashed them all at once. Over the last year, I’ve found them in my travel shampoo, medications, laptop bag, tucked between the tongue and laces of my work boots, etc.

Late last year, I was gone for two months. She was pregnant with our second child at the time, and it sucked being away from home. But coming across the occasional stray duck always made my day a little brighter.

One night after work, I got a call to my hotel room that there was a package for me at the front desk. I went down to get it and retrieved a parcel that was about the size of an engagement ring box. When I opened it, a small handful of tiny ducks poured out. It made me so happy!!

She told me she made a point to note where she’d hidden every single duck, and she has a list of their hides in her phone. When I account for all 200, I get one big special surprise. So far, I’ve only found 73…",59,0,706,706,,706,Kaladrax182,FjohursLykkewe,0

wtf is this apps picture 😂,"Mobile ""advertising,"" is a puzzle and a plague. It's designed that way specifically to get you to go ""what the fuck is this game?"" and get you to download it to find out. Mobile games these days are less about getting 100 people to download and enjoy it for a long time, and more about getting 100,000 people to download it for 5 second, see a single ad, and then delete it.

Other methods include:

* Frustration baiting: Showing someone fucking up an extremely simple puzzle. Triggers the ""I can do that better,"" response and gets people to download.
* ""Borderline sexual,"" content: Likely (and disturbingly) aimed at the middle school audience to get them to download. It makes them feel like they're breaking the rules while also not getting the app rated for explicit content. They're still young enough to blindly buy things with their parents credit card, so financially speaking it's a good audience to target.
* Misrepresenting the game entirely: It's cheap to re-skin some kind of existing puzzle or UI-only management game and hire an animator to make an unrelated animation to advertise it.

"April Fools, Prank the School","I sneaked into my kids' middle school a few years ago - late in the day before April 1st - and put ballots in the teacher's mailbox outside each classroom. The school's mascot was a blue jay and as they are the ""bullies of the bird world"" the kids were asked to vote for a new mascot. You'll see from the ballot that there were some bizarre choices.   
  
  
The next morning I called the local paper to share that this school was making an anti-bullying stand by changing its mascot. What I didn't know was that our Principal's husband worked at the paper, so he was informed immediately.  
  
  
Back on campus, a lot of teachers just went ahead and handed out the ballots and kids voted. But a few called the Principal's office, curious that this was the first they'd heard about a vote. She then went around and took everything out of each room. She was not happy with me. But what a great memory for everyone there.  
  
  
It was one of my all-time favorite pranks, right up there with how I spent 4 years in college entertaining and surprising that school.",4,0,18,18,,18,SalesAutopsy,SalesAutopsy,0

Bro was so into the role that he became Elsa,"When I was in school, my teacher thought I was too confident about my spot in the drama group and it had gotten into my head. So I didn’t get an acting role this season. What I got was a curtain controller role to work BTS. I got so pissed and didn’t want to show up. But my friends convinced me to be the best curtain controller ever which I reluctantly agreed to.
Guys! I managed to shine in my roll however. There was a time when the actors lost their plot and I used my intuition to close the curtain fast enough that the audience didn’t notice. There was also a time I closed the curtain when I felt like they were beginning to reveal too much about the end sequence. This created a lot of suspense in the minds of the audience. The show was saved by me ones more because everyone was saying “God bless the curtains guy” .
This kid reminded me about myself. He got a BTS roll but still managed to do it superbly that he shined.",11,0,66310,66310,,66310,Spill-your-last-load,ihthisham4me2,0

"Downstairs neighbor thinks I should ""take some lessons in walking""","There are definitely different ways of walking, and heavy walkers are oblivious to how loud they are. I walk more on the balls of my feet and make little to no noise. My wife walks more on her heals and literally stomps around the house like a crazy person. Could all come down to how we were raised(she a country girl in a farm house and I a city boy gowning up in an apartment setting). Now I'm not saying that you're purposely stomping around your house, but you could be walking more heavily than you may realize. As someone who recently went through the toddler with a newborn phase of life, OPs neighbor is stressed, sleep deprived, and only has free time when the kiddos are sleeping. I can understand his anger if OPs walking actually woke the kids up. Easy solution, ask neighbor of you could come inside as you have a friend walk around your place.

I actually understand how hard it is when you live under a heavy walker (stomper) with young children but if he has been this upset for over a year and has never even talked to them isn't fair either. You keep stuff like this inside, you overreact when you've been putting up with it for a year. 

You never know. The neighbor could have a medical condition which causes him to walk heavy. How would you know if you only send letters and don't have a conversation....and no matter how perfect one's babies are, they keep your neighbors up at night too, I am sure. So before you freak out, think of all parties instead of just your bubble.

it dives you absolutely fucking insane listening to your roof being stomped on all day long and into the night, the banging, the heavy foot stomps, the literal noise of everything from upstairs being projected into your sitting room or bed room.

I completely side with him, the other guy who posted this picture hasn't a fucking clue what it's like to listen to this shit every fucking day, like you don't have to walk like bigfoot, hammering down your feet as you walk, there are people who live below you so have some respect, I understand it feels shit having to walk slowly at night time to suit your downstairs neighbor but show some respect, he's not hitting the shit out of his roof/your floor with a broom handle all day every day and if he did you would understand what he is listing to.

Go downstairs and have a talk with the guy and square shit out it's not right to live like this with your downstairs neighbor, try work something out.

And as a professional floor fitter for more then 10 years I can tell you for a fact you have the wrong underlayment underneath your wooden floor....ITS SUPPOSED TO BE SOUNDPROOFED IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIVING BELOW YOU, in most country's is actually the law to have it soundproofed.

It's like this person learned how to reply to people by arguing online. This is not effective. This is stupid

Maybe OP is walking around too loud. Maybe the neighbors are oversensitive.

 I have a downstairs neighbor, and our floors are very thin. At a certain time of night I start being a bit more conscientious of how much noise I make. 

The reason I'm so considered of my downstairs neighbor is because she asked me, politely, to be considerate. She told me when she was in bed and when she was awake, help me understand which parts of the is over her bedroom, and we found an accommodation and got along. And so because she's always nice to me and I'm always nice to her, we tolerate each other and work together to make life better for both of us so we don't have conflict.

The world would be a better place if we could learn to talk to each other respectfully. I'm very lucky that my neighbor raised these issues early and an employee way. Because it could have turned into a conflict.

The letter is excessive given first contact but the motivation might actually be legitimate and there is some degree of the OPs potential ignorance of the issue that might be on them.

It’s funny that even now, with just one child at home, and the child being a skinny 12 year old girl, I still have to buy two gallons of milk at a time and mark them 1/2, and 2/2.

Letting them struggle and learn to manipulate, getting away with a “sorry, I’ll never do it again” instead of any actual consequences like grounding; no more phone, no after school activities, only necessities in bedroom and chores, lots and lots of chores. Telling an out of control child or teenager they’re responsible for their actions while never providing the guidance they need to handle their emotions and frustrations. Not wanting to be the adult in the room and mentoring/teaching children how to interact and behave properly. And I know some people will lose their minds reading this thinking I’m advocating beating your kids and making them fear you. Discipline and consequences come in many forms. I was never disciplined without knowing why, and being given the support and guidance I needed, right along with my punishment.

Serious dangers in the classroom
Student safety during student assault
State and district school safety regulations
Etc..
When folks didn't answer the email, I sent the demand and agenda by registered mail, return receipt requested, cc'd to risk management, the superintendant and the local paper

Prior to this, I was stuck with 40 students per class, including 15ish special ed kids, in a Shop class with no help..

My dad works in schools and he found this discipline notice,"As others pointed out, this looks like a fake write up and either exaggerated or imagined.  But as the husband of a first grade teacher that has to hear my wife break down about the crazy shit that goes on at school, I can attest it isn't as far off as you might imagine.

Teachers are under so much scrutiny to achieve results, they spend more time performing mandated testing than actual teaching. When students misbehave, the principles and leadership are too afraid to make those tough calls. Instead, children that need special attention, correction, or in some extreme cases, medication, are instead just pushed off to an unqualified and overburdened teacher to deal with.  

My wife teaches about 25 first graders, and yet she has one student that is WELL beyond the spectrum, to a level that the entire class bends to his/her will when an outburst occurs.  Despite multiple requests for parent intervention or relocation, the parents continually refuse to acknowledge a problem and have hindered all attempts to help this poor child (and my poor wife, lol).

EDIT: To clarify 'outburst', this student cannot learn in this classroom. They have literally come back to the classroom from bathroom break after visibly have eaten shit, will literally yell and interrupt an entire lesson, even in the hallway. Has ran and tackled through teachers to flee, and generally, sleeps whenever the fuck the rest of the class is lucky enough (my wife doesn't even wake them at that point). The first grade students literally fear and despise being stuck with them there. And that's just this year's woes.",1,0,2101,2101,,2101,dragoonjefy,Adensstuff,0

We are not even allowed to take away privileges for students who commit crimes under the law. It’s “not equitable.” Well society is going to have to deal with the consequences in a few years.

My dad works in schools and he found this discipline notice,"We had one situation in my high school in which a student wasn’t the problem, but rather one of the teachers in a certain class.  

Nondescript, innocuous-looking man of middle age.  

This was at a time when many of the young ladies still wore dresses or skirt and blouse combinations.  

Mr. Reynolds was in charge of the seating assignments, of course.  And it quickly became obvious that the more attractive girls with the shortest skirts were, for some reason, assigned seats at the very front of the room.  

Mr. R liked to lecture, and would, as he did so, pace casually back and froth directly in front of, and very near to, this front row of seats. Habitually twirling between his fingers the pencil he used as a prop. 

Clumsy man that he was, he managed to drop said pencil with surprising frequency.  And always directly in front of one of our aforementioned female classmates.  Bending over and teaching down to retrieve it, he would turn his face just so, hoping for a quick upskirt peek of something he wasn’t supposed to see. The man could not have been more obvious.  

One of the girls had enough of it one day.  She waited for the inevitable pencil drop and following attempted peekery.  Timed it just right, and kicked him in the face.  

The poor guy had a black eye for a week, and thereafter behaved himself, lol.",1,0,2101,2101,,2101,itsallalittleblurry,Adensstuff,0

She’d step in and curl around the inside of the pan with just her head out of the water.

"Found a strange animal in the shower, this can't be a cat","Cats are often associated with an aversion to water. The common image of a cat running away from water or avoiding it altogether is deeply ingrained in popular culture. However, it is important to note that not all cats are afraid of water. In fact, some cats have been known to enjoy it.

One of the primary reasons why cats are generally considered to be afraid of water is because they are meticulous groomers. They spend a significant portion of their day cleaning themselves, and they have a natural aversion to anything that can disrupt their grooming routine. Water can make their fur clump together and become matted, which can be uncomfortable for the cat. Additionally, cats are not natural swimmers, and they can become easily disoriented and stressed when placed in water.

Despite these tendencies, there are some cats that do not exhibit a fear of water. These cats are often found in specific breeds, such as the Turkish Van and the Bengal. These breeds have been known to enjoy the water and have even been observed swimming. It is thought that this affinity for water may be genetic, passed down from their ancestors who lived in environments with significant bodies of water.

Other cats may develop an affinity for water through exposure and training. Kittens that are introduced to water at a young age may become accustomed to it and even enjoy it. This can be especially true for cats that are regularly bathed or have access to a source of running water, such as a fountain or stream.

Another reason why some cats may not be afraid of water is that they simply have a more curious and adventurous personality. These cats are often less cautious and more willing to explore new experiences, including water. These cats may be more prone to exploring areas near water, such as ponds or rivers, and may even dip their paws in the water or swim if the opportunity presents itself.

It is important to note that not all cats will enjoy the water, and forcing a cat to interact with water can be stressful and traumatic for the animal. However, for cats that do enjoy the water, there are many benefits to providing them with opportunities to interact with it. Water can provide a stimulating and enriching environment for cats, and it can help to keep their coats clean and healthy. Additionally, cats that are able to swim can benefit from the exercise and mental stimulation that comes with it.

In conclusion, while many cats are known for their aversion to water, there are some cats that enjoy it. Whether through genetics, exposure, or personality, these cats are able to overcome their natural tendencies and find enjoyment in the water. For cat owners, it is important to understand that each cat is unique and may have different preferences when it comes to water. By providing a safe and stimulating environment, cat owners can help their feline companions lead happy and healthy lives, whether they enjoy water or not.",2,0,57226,57226,,57226,Superkid4879,SinjiOnO,0

"Found a strange animal in the shower, this can't be a cat","All cats are different, but also all the same.  I've lived with about a dozen in my life, up to seven cats in our house at once, and they all have different personalities, likes, and dislikes.

Some like popcorn and will steal pieces out of the bowl, while the others couldn't care less.  Others go psycho when you eat breakfast cereal.  One cat we had would play with the mouse-on-the-string by himself, taking the stick in his mouth and pushing it around until the mouse got his attention, and then he would attack the mouse.  Another would lay on me as I slept, no matter how much I moved or thrashed around, she would come back and settle in again.  Another insisted on sleeping on my girlfriend's neck at night, no matter what.  Another would insist we go to bed about 10:00 every night, and would meow and make our life a hell until we shut off the TV and went to bed, then she would purr her head off and fall asleep between us.

"Found a strange animal in the shower, this can't be a cat","Story time---

I had the best cat, Thomas (renamed Issues by my toddler son learning to speak and became his name from there on out for everyone), and he would shower on my chest, play fetch, and was just in general very cool. Years later, 5-7 years if I remember correct, my wife and I were fighting over her not cleaning the cat box. It was her chore, 1 of the very few she was expected to do, and it wasn't getting done and I was very frustrated and we were fighting about it frequently. One day while hanging out with the neighbors, one of the neighbors 40 pound half adult pit pups broke free and was running down the stairs, and I went to chase it up. The cat was across the yard, saw me yelling, saw the baby pit and it looked like it was charging me if you didn't know any better. Next thing I know my cat comes from out of nowhere and chased this pup around the complex twice before I was able to grab him and the pup made his way back to his home. I told my wife that he had a home for life that night, I thought what he did trying to protect me was amazing, and stinky cat box or not, he was awesome. That same freaking weekend, my kids and I went out of town to visit my dad, and that came didn't come home.

A quick story if you will!

I remember visiting a wealthy relatives fancy house, one of those 6 bed 12 bath houses, with closets larger than my tiny shit apartment. Above said closets, at like 10' in the air,  was another tiny closet, maybe 2' x 2', accordion doors, beautiful trim but again,  10 feet up.

I'd stay up at night baffled at what could possibly be up there?! What esoteric value could this possibly hold?! Everyone I asked sid check it and I said I couldn't, the mystery behind it was so grandiose at this point, that much Like pandoras box, it could only harbor existential nightmares.

Finally I overcame my existence dread after 4 long sleepless nights and opened it. Do you know what I found inside? Do you?!

Nothing.

Many would've moved on but for me, that only deepened the mystery further!

I remember being disappointed it wasn't a creepy doll head like this.

Came across this when souvenir shopping in Tokyo,"As someone who has ordered a few japanese fleshlights (called onaholes), I'll say some are actually decent quality.

However, and this isn't to be funny or mean or anything, you have to be careful because some of them can be really small. Too small even. I'm not even remotely bragging or anything. Read western/US reviews and they'll tell you the same thing. Some of these are just too small. I've had to throw away like 2 of them because they weren't useable. Wasted like 150 dollars (shipping is crazy).

So if you ever buy one, keep that in mind. And don't buy the one that's called R-20 or something. They made that one for freakishly large penises. That thing is like a hallway. Threw it away after using it like twice. I thought I could use it to pretend it was a giant orc woman or something, but...it was just so mediocre.

And I forgot the name of this one I got...but it was clear...and dude. I put my index finger in it with some lotion it came with and it squeezed my finger so hard it actually hurt and completely put me out of the mood. Had to throw it away...

I would say the best brand is Magic Eyes. The best one I can recommend is the original ""Mouth of Truth"" but don't get this as your first one. Just don't. It'll be too weird. A good first one is one called ""The Gimmick"". That one feels the most realistic that I've tried. But none of them feel 100% real I don't think. But you get to like 90%. I've never tried Tenga because they're really...boring I guess. There's no artistry. No theatrics. And I never used bad dragon because I don't want to band animals.

Three times in two years he went online, filled their s**t out, did their online training and was given an interview date and time.  Each time for a different McDonalds location.  Every time he went in he was told the manager didn’t work that shift / day and to come back at noon on whatever day…. When he went back he was then told the manager was to busy to see him and to come back later…. No time / day specified.  I’m surprised anyone actually works there.

In the mean time he’s learned a good life lesson….

He took some of what he thought were good jobs, only to be disappointed and left those as soon as he found something else.  He now works for another smaller chain has personal contact with that franchise’s owner, is decently paid by people that value his contribution to the team (even though it’s small) and is given all the hours he’s able (allowed) to work and time off for school / after school events like sports with no hassle.  Of course he provides advanced notice of time off needed as much as possible (f you too basketball coach that changes practice schedule every other damn day) and is willing to fill in when someone can’t make it in.

Also, the better pay at Chick-Fil-A and Culvers seems to attract older workers. Chipotle and McDs are a bunch of kids who don't give a shit and, frankly, aren't paid enough to care.

The machines are purposely difficult to maintain and troubleshoot which always ends with the managers having to call the certified repair technicians from Taylor. The kick is that McD isn’t paying for the repairs, it’s the franchise owners that are footing the bill.

Their locations cannot be too far from a distribution center, to ensure fresh never frozen beef, which is why they’re only in certain places. 

Although in-n-out has 1/3rd of the locations that Whattaburger has (387 to 937) they have a net worth of 3 billion dollars, where as Whattaburger only has a net worth of 160 million.

Still in shock,"Infinite cum. You sit on the toilet to jack off, but you begin to cum uncontrollably. After ten spurts you start to worry. Your hand is sticky and it reeks of semen. You desperately shove your dick into a wad of toilet paper, but that only makes your balls hurt. The cum accelerates. It’s been three minutes. You can’t stop cumming. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum. The cum accelerates. You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses. The cum accelerates. It’s been two hours. Your children and wife scream in terror as their bodies are engulfed by the snow-white sludge. Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. The cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird’s eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. The cum accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The cum accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the “Cummet.” You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.",4,0,898,898,,898,KeepCalmAndProgress,Proof_Operation_1382,0

Definitely use birth control; a condom or any birth control pills you can still get. I can't believe that people haven't started importing birth control pill from Mexico and Canada. Maybe, probably they still have.

But this is something that you need a doctor to keep you taking the correct drugs, the correct amount etc.

This stupid law (all of them that are trying to make birth control as difficult as possible) is just going to result in a lot of women going to the black market.  And that is really dangerous because you can't trust the black market to sell you what you need. (They are liable to sell you fentanyl.)

an unforgettable exchange with the delivery boy,"This is the song of a socially awkward person who acts on impulse, has no filter, and often doesn’t realize what they’ve said is inappropriate or uncomfortable until after the fact. Sometimes, long after the fact. 

Anyone who is even slightly neurodivergent, socially awkward, struggles making friends, or just had a rough patch growing up as an awkward teenager can identify with the thought process going on here. Anyone who feels like they just keep talking when they’re flustered and should have stopped 5 minutes ago feels this. And it’s funny. Not always because it’s objective humor, but because some of us have been there. We have said and done things that sent us on a slippery slope of not knowing how to stop or back track and it just makes everything else worse. You add in the repressed sexual urges and it accentuates the awkwardness and dude, it’s just hilarious. 

Remember: not all content is aimed at you. If you think it’s not funny, don’t watch it. But I’ve made my fair share of social blunders. I’ve been awkward. I’ve learned from it. So I enjoyed this bit.",28,0,18490,18490,,18490,Joe4o2,Asharpist,0

As far as big juicy dicks… I might have been less receptive in my 20’ or 30’s, sure, but today in my 40’s? I can wrap my head around it, I can hear about sexuality that isn’t centered around my own experience. And also, you know, that’s good storytelling. It should be able to make you forget yourself and imagine the headspace of a quirky female comedian, like sorta kinda being a little turned on by the rough outline of a dick in basketball shorts. Oh wait, that’s your balls? That’s funny. It doesn’t make you gay to laugh or feel empathy. Let the juicy dick humor warm your heart, folks. Let the warm laughter pique your interest and wash over you in waves of profound euphoria.

Idk, I think sometimes you get the laughs, sometimes you’re just planting seeds to grow later.

I’m t was one of my top 5 appraisals for being different. The car had 2700 miles on it. Key in the ignition. And 40 inches of dust and dirt. But the paint in it still looked fair. Well at least the patch I cleaned off did. Lol,1,0,71688,71688,,71688,Known-Skin3639,flyingorange,0

"The Tooth Fairy is on a tight schedule, kid","It’s sometimes easier to tie a floss around the tooth in one loop, like the first part of tying your shoes, and then pull the floss slowly like a knot.

Yanking like that is usually an indicator that you’re rushing things a bit. Those teeth hold the space for the permanent teeth, so no need to rush it!

For the whole length of the leash to stay on the table he would have to either drag it up paw over paw (or jaw over paw) or he could walk around on the table long enough and far enough that the leash followed him up there.

Ever notice that single-serve cheese slices are the same size as Post-It Notes?,"Romans made roads, and they standardised the wheel width of carriages so that they would fit.

Modern roads, and therefore the size of cargo are defined by these ancient roman standards.

Shipping crates got standardised in the 1800s, and further refined during ww2. These further refinements include optimal sizes for boxes inside crates, and even optimal object size/ratios. 

To minimise shipping costs, products are designed with these standards. This leads to lots of things having a similar or equal size, as there is a finite number of sizes that will tessellate within a rectangular prism (when talking about objects in boxes in crates in trucks).

I like how a Nintendo DS has exactly the same dimensions as a pack of rolling tobacco as an example of how stuff is made to be shipped. (although these things are also ""standard pants pocket"" sized)",0,0,9975,9975,,9975,Ghazzz,Devonai,0

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/funny) if you have any questions or concerns.*",1,0,12,12,"TL;DR (now with spoiler options):  >!My wife has taken her car in on her own for oil changes and routine maintenance the last two times...First time she came told me the estimate was $20K (actually $2K) and the second time, she told me they needed to change out her engine (see the end of the story for the ""punch (to the gut) line""!<

Background:  I am my wife's biggest fan.  I know she is capable of anything (even giving me a heart attack), but I also know that she has struggle areas (I do too, you should see me try to do anything creative, but I digress).  Two of these areas are finance and car maintenance.

I'm not saying I'm good at car maintenance, but she's not even good about taking it in for routine maintenance, so we're working on those things.

The last two times she's taken her car in, I've been hands off so she can learn the process.  I told her I knew the first time in, we'd have a pretty big bill because it had been awhile, so I told her to put it on the credit card and we'd pay it as we can (don't tell r/personalfinance ....not my favorite thing to do, but she needs an operating vehicle for her commute and we didn't have the cash on hand)...anyway

She gets her estimate back and texts me that she's got it in hand.

Me: Ok, what's the damage (pun intended)

Her:...........it's bad

Me: \*bracing for impact\* what's the total, we can manage it.....

Her: $20K

Me: \*gasping for air\* WHAT?!

I can't get words out, I trust these guys, are they really trying to screw over my wife?  There's no way

As I'm catching my breath....

Her: Oh, wait, sorry, that's $2K

Good God, woman!  This is a huge difference, but I'm fairly relieved (perhaps it was a smart move on her part to make the $2k GOOD news).

Second round happened yesterday

We dropped her car off Monday night because her appointment was first thing on Tuesday morning...again, I have limited involvement as she's more than capable of handling her business

I work from home now, and she was off yesterday, so she came in my office and said she had her estimate...I had forgotten about the $20K incident at this point, so I wasn't braced at all

Me: Ok, what's the damage (I need new jokes because the pun was still intended)

Her: Ugh, I can't believe this!

Me: what's the deal?

Her: They need to change my engine!

Me: \*gasping for air\* WHAT?!  How is that possible?  Sure the car is getting older (2013 CR-V), but there's barely 100K miles on it, no evidence of major issues, surely they'd call if.....wait a minute, lemme see the estimate, plz""

Once upon a midnight dreary, in a cantina, warm and cheery, Nursing hunger, stomach weary, dreaming of a feast I'd savor, While I pondered, growing fonder, of that fare from far yonder, Thoughts of food would make me wander, wander to the tales of flavor. ""'Tis a craving,"" said I, ""for a feast I long to savor, Only this and nothing more.""


Ah, distinctly I remember, in the bleak and dark December, Every ember seemed to whisper, ""Burritos shall restore."" Eagerly I sought the morrow; vainly had I sought to borrow From my books, surcease of sorrow, sorrow for the lost flavor, For the feast my palate craved, the taste I longed to savor, Nameless here forevermore.


Suddenly, there came a tapping, as of someone gently rapping, Rapping at the cantina door. ""'Tis a visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at the cantina door, Only this and nothing more.""
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately burrito of the flavors I adore. Not the least obeisance made it; not a moment stopped or stayed it; But, with the air of a lord or lady, perched beside my chamber door, Perched upon a plate of splendor, just beside my chamber door, Perched and sat and nothing more.


Then this burrito, beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By its savory and spicy countenance, it bore, ""Though thy taste be bold and daring, thou,"" I said, ""art sure no craven, Ghastly, grim, and ancient burrito wandering from the yonder shore, Tell me what thy flavors are, that I may forevermore explore, Quoth the burrito, ""Nevermore.""",22,AutoModerator,strangeattractors,0
A poem about burritos written in the style of Edgar Allen Poe.,"LoL


Once upon a midnight dreary,
I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a savory dish and more,
Of Mexican cuisine, I do implore.

Enchiladas, tacos, and tamales,
Burritos, chimichangas, and chiles,
Salsa, guacamole, and queso galore,
The Raven nevermore.

Huevos rancheros, chilaquiles, and menudo,
Pico de gallo, refried beans, and elote,
Ceviche, mole, and pozole,
The Raven nevermore.

Crispy carnitas and tender barbacoa,
Spicy al pastor and juicy carne asada,
Fluffy rice and creamy frijoles,
The Raven nevermore.

My stomach growled with each passing minute,
For I could not resist this food, I admit it,
I savored every bite and every flavor,
The Raven nevermore.

And as I finished my last bite,
I bid farewell to the Mexican delight,
For though it may be gone for now,
I'll come back again, I vow.

And as I drifted off to sleep,
My dreams were filled with tacos deep,
And as I snored with satisfied glee,
The Raven cried ""Nevermore!"" with envy.",6,0,22,22,"Burritos, evermore.
