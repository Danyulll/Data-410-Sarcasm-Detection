While we're at this, you don't need to ""melt"" the steel beams. Grandma forgets that both towers were hit by what amounts to a *three hundred ton* *missiles* going a couple of hundred miles an hour. The impact *plus the fire* was enough to compromise the structural integrity of beams holding up the floors above them, when they went, that caused the floors above to fall and the sudden shock and weight of all that falling material was too much for the floors beneath the damaged sections to handle. That's why it collapsed.

But let's take a step back here and think about this ""logically"".

- First and third are very closely related. Rates go up in response to high inflation, so if inflation is up, rates going up are expected.

- War? Really? We were in a war through the entirety of Trump’s presidency. Biden literally got us out of war, in a move Trump laughed at. You can’t have it both ways.

- Vaccination is another dumb one. Not a single citizen was “forced” to get vaccinated, Biden was no exception. I know the right guffaws at the idea that Biden doesn’t make his own choices, but they both were vaccinated voluntarily.

- Dementia one is unfounded, so thrown out from lack of evidence.

Whenever I bring this up people ask “but how do you enforce it? How would we even know if they did a background check or not?” The answer is you don’t make sure everyone is doing a background check, but if someone sold a gun to a convicted murderer, they can’t just say “I didn’t know” which means people aren’t going to be able to smuggle guns as well as they can now AND that there is now a disincentive to skipping the background check because you know that if the person is a criminal you could be in hot water.",6,0,33,33,,33,anonymous-grapefruit,Cicerothesage,0

There has always been in our national experience a type of mind which elevates hatred to a kind of creed; for this mind, group hatreds take a place in politics similar to the class struggle in some other modern societies. Filled with obscure and ill-directed grievances and frustrations, with elaborate hallucinations about secrets and conspiracies, groups of malcontents have found scapegoats at various times in Masons or abolitionists, Catholics, Mormons, or Jews, Negroes, or immigrants, the liquor interests or the international bankers. In the succession of scapegoats chosen by the followers of this tradition of Know-Nothingism, the intelligentsia have at last in our time found a place."" - Richard Hofstadter, Anti-Intellectualism in American Life, ~~2023~~ 1963",2,0,1651,1651,,1651,valvilis,Cicerothesage,0

So now the conspiracists are pretending they ""knew all along"" about the origin of the virus, like they ever actually had a coherent narrative, ""*I told you so*,"" etc. But as far as I'm concerned, who cares if you were ""right"" like a stuck clock three years ago if you're now denying the cure?

It's amazing how often they completely mischaracterize Soros' words here in that interview. For one, Soros was *14* and his comments about what made his character and what were the proudest moments of his life, was seeing his *father* risk his life to smuggle other Jews out of the country.

Further, Soros wasn't a Nazi collaborator. What Soros' family was doing, was having him pose as the child of a collaborator government official as an effort to hide him. Part of this involved him attending the auditing of Jewish property. His job in those instances was literally to act like a book boy. That's it.

Also, I find it kind of funny how right-wingers continue to insist that *they* shouldn't be held liable for the sins of their forefathers (in regards to slavery, segregation, etc) but here, they're doing just that.

Grandma is bootlicking for our corporate overlords,"I get that this is photoshopped and it really shows $15 (or maybe $22 depending on where and when the original is from), but really it’s Grandma who doesn’t understand economics.

Our entire economy is supported by consumer spending.  If people can no longer afford to buy things, revenue goes down across the board.  Now, we should already understand that companies (and more importantly investors) have an (unsustainable) expectation of infinite growth so a decrease in revenue is unacceptable.  Cue cost cuts (delayed or denied bonuses, hiring freezes, layoffs, etc) and increased prices to try and maintain perpetual growth.  The cost saving employment measures and increased prices then force even more people to cut back on spending which, you guessed it, puts even more downward pressure on revenue.  The cycle then continues on.

Sticky inflation and talk of recession these days are merely our first pass through the cycle.  Our economy simply cannot survive as it is currently organized if people cannot afford to keep spending (which is a whole different issue).

Tbh, the whole “drag queen story time” (if that’s what this is referring to) is pretty transparent indoctrination tho. I want repeat, I don’t really care because I think it’s pretty harmless indoctrination. But it’s transparent because it’s not like there is a trend of “electrical engineer story time” or “LARPer story time” or “insert any niche anything - story time” events. But, with the current political climate, of course there would be “drag queen story time.” Again, who cares? Unless you believe that it’s some threat to your children which of course right-wing trad parents would, so I am in no way surprised by their reaction to it.

So when a parent goes out of their way to take their kids to “drag queen story time” (or whatever) it’s a pretty obvious move by that parent trying to instill something in their child. Not sure what tho. I have never run into a drag queen outside of an event so maybe they just want their kids to enjoy drag shows like some parents want their kids to enjoy sports? Fuck if I know…

Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
**Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
Glows world-wide welcome**; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.

""Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!"" cries she
With silent lips. **""Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!""**

But a username like ""patriot Fire"" tells me this is actually one of the Trump supporters that went ""well if you persecute the J6 protestors they'll just rise even higher to power look at the Nazis"" when the problem was the German police and judges were sympathetic to Hitler and sent him to a fancy castle prison for 6 months of his 5 year sentence, let him write a book, and then let him out way earlier than he was sentenced.

I got it from my husband when he had zero symptoms but didn’t get it from my kids despite all the symptoms and them being all over me. The reason Covid wreaked such havoc is because it presented in people so many different ways. 

Lockdowns did flatten the curve but all states being locked down at different times did nothing to stop it from spreading. Quarantining healthy people was to keep them healthy. 

Covid wings and ERs were overloaded to the point that they were mobile testing sites and mobile morgue  units. People were being treated in hallways. Hospitals specializing in plastic surgery or elective surgeries sat empty as those had to halt. Not everyone is capable of treating a virus just like an epidemiologist can’t perform plastic surgery. 

Idk what Community triggers means. 

Masks + barriers + distancing + vaccine was a multi pronged approach to do what we could to stop this thing because none on their own were silver bullets. It’s almost like a highly contagious new virus is unpredictable and difficult to control. 

School & business closures - I live in a fully red state that shut down for months so can’t really blame Dems for that one. 

Covid upended everything. People are mad and want someone to blame for Covid but that’s not how it works.

Ask white people if they'd feel just the same about seeing a white ""thug"" in Harlem compared to a Black ""thug"", or why Children have showcased in studies to refer to white kids as the ""good"" kids and dark skinned kids as the ""bad"" kids, for no other explanation than ""they look like me"".

If a smaller demographic makes up a larger proportion of specific crime, and criminal justice, prisons, voting systems, social and political norms, and ""news"" all seem to show particular bias against those demographics, stemming from very slowly drifting paths of overt racism, it's not a hard conclusion to reach.

Fossils are found in a variety of rock formations dating to the Maastrichtian age of the Upper Cretaceous period, 68 to 66 million years ago. It was the last known member of the tyrannosaurids and among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.  
  
T. rex was one of the largest land carnivores of all time. One of the largest and the most complete specimens, nicknamed Sue, is about 12 m long, and 4 m tall at the hips.

>About a quarter of adults who were raised Muslim (23%) no longer identify as members of the faith, roughly on par with the share of Americans who were raised Christian and no longer identify with Christianity (22%), according to a new analysis of the 2014 Religious Landscape Study. But while the share of American Muslim adults who are converts to Islam also is about one-quarter (23%), a much smaller share of current Christians (6%) are converts.

But when society places hundreds of proletarians in such a position that they inevitably meet a too early and an unnatural death, one which is quite as much a death by violence as that by the sword or bullet; when it deprives thousands of the necessaries of life, places them under conditions in which they cannot live – forces them, through the strong arm of the law, to remain in such conditions until that death ensues which is the inevitable consequence – knows that these thousands of victims must perish, and yet permits these conditions to remain, its deed is murder just as surely as the deed of the single individual; disguised, malicious murder, murder against which none can defend himself, which does not seem what it is, because no man sees the murderer, because the death of the victim seems a natural one, since the offence is more one of omission than of commission.

asshole grandma doesn't understand why the school may want to protect a queer kid from her assholery,"I do understand the sentiment that this image is trying to get across though. When people groom children, one of the things they will do is to make little secrets with the child, and say 'now don't tell your mum!'

At first they start off innocent enough. In my case, my mum didn't let me drink coke, so this guy would always give me coke when we'd visit his family. And it was always ""it's our secret, don't tell anyone or we'll get into trouble!""

Then it gets a bit less innocent. For me, it progressed to alcohol. The guy was giving me vodka cruisers when I was 10. He'd always say to be sure to keep it a secret because it was illegal and we'd get into big trouble with the police. He convinced me that it was nothing bad though, and that it barely had any alcohol in it and it was mainly sugar water. I thought it was so cool I could have an adult drink with him - I genuinely believed he saw me as mature and an equal. At least, that's what he had me feeling. 

A couple more years and I would have been in his age bracket. Girls that had just hit puberty, around 12-15 years old. The secret then would have been ""Show me this"" or ""touch that"", but always, ""it's our little secret."" And I would have kept it a secret because I trusted this guy so much, and had so many other secrets with him that I didn't tell anyone else. 

It took a good decade after he was put into jail for paedophilia before I realised exactly what he was doing with me. Grooming me. Training me to keep secrets for him. It's scary to think what would have happened if he hadn't been locked up.

So, I have to agree with grandma here. Adults that ask kids to keep secrets for them from their parents, are probably more interested in nefarious activities than protecting the kid. Obviously a school counsellor is different, but the image doesn't specify health care workers, just random adults.",20,0,164,164,,164,celaeya,Cicerothesage,0

I can go ahead and set you up for our yearly subscription, which includes police service, for one low monthly price of 349.00. Keep in mind this is just for us to come. You will still get billed for any water used to put out the fire and a bill if you need the ambulance service.

Once the charge goes through I will dispatch the fire truck. And wait on the line because there will be a brief survey and an option to leave a tip. Which I strongly suggest because it will determine how quickly they get to you.

In other words, towns and cities can simply refuse to participate, but they’ll lose federal funding. What’s wrong with this?

The priority of the federal government is (currently, as evidenced by this new rule) to improve the living conditions of the poorest Americans and reduce economic segregation. A town or city can opt out of receiving federal funds if they aren’t interested in trying to help *all* their citizens live a better life. Simple as that.

I don’t want my federal tax dollars going to places that prefer to separate people based on income.

What this means is that they’ll build a large structure full of pretty expensive units and then designate the shittiest one to be the “affordable” option. Sometimes they’ll quietly raise the prices on these units and evict their low income tenants but keep the tax credit.

Because even after slavery, America has done very little to help Black people on par with white people, and plenty to harm or further limit opportunities for Black people.

For comparison, Germany didn't finish paying its debts from WWI until 2010. In 2010, no German had launched mustard gas or marched men to their deaths or personally. By 2010 just 21 people who had served in WWI were believed to still be alive around the world, for all intents and purposes it wasn't anyone's problem any more. Between WWI and 2010 Germany went from being an empire to a republic to a fascist dictatorship to two separate countries to being reunified as a single country, and still we expected them to pay their debts.

well the complex eukaryotic cell came from prokaryotic cells, which has a much more simple form with a loosely wrapped nucleoid instead of a cell nucleus, a few ribosomes and a cell wall.

I wish this were satire,"Yea well, the first eukaryotic cell took one BILLION years to arrive, and it wouldn't have looked anything nearly as good looking as that one. BILLION. And that's just the time. Assuming the doubling time of prokaryotes hasn't changed much (~2 per hour), you're looking at 40,000  (4x10^4) iterations per year. But that's just if there were one bacterium cranking away, the whole aspect of ""doubling"" means for most of time, you have to consider the whole earth as biomass. Let's take a typical estimate of 10^30, and be wildly cautious, so 10^25.

That means there were something like (10^7)•(10^4)•(10•25) ==> 10^36 iterations until a bumbling, barely functional eukaryotic cell came to the scene. Humans can't properly internalize orders of magnitude though, so to just TRY to put it properly to scale, that's 10000000000000000000000000000000000000 iterations before ending up with at least a mitochondrion and MAYBE a nascent nuclear envelope. To get actual multicellular life, it took at least something like another 500 million years, so another 5000000000000000000000000000000000000 iterations. 

To put this to scale, the average person might make something like 50k/yr. Or 50,000. If they work for 50 years, pushing past the standard years of retirement, that's $2500000. A multibillionaire has, to their name, $100000000 -- that's it. And that's an absolutely massive, ungodly amount of money! And you couldn't possibly make a graph to somehow represent those two things  similarly.

So people ask: ""I mean, how likely is it that life like this arose randomly?"" The answer: absurdly improbable. That's why it took 10000000000000000000000000000000000000 + 5000000000000000000000000000000000000 iterations to do so.",2,0,1724,1724,,1724,Redstonefreedom,Social_History,0

grandma is the low effort thinker here,"I’m a critical thinker, so let’s see…

“Who is telling me to support the efforts?”
Scientists and other experts who study this stuff for a living.

“Have they lied to us in the past?”
No.

“Does the “solution” centre on individuals or gov’t?”
It centres mostly on big corporations honestly, putting their corporate interests above the safety of the planet.

“Who benefits financially from the “solutions?”
No one, that’s why nothing’s really being done. It costs money to change these things, with no financial return on the investment. Corporate greed is a powerful thing.

“Do the “solutions” take control over your own life and give it to authoritarians?”
No. No it does not. “Authoritarian” is just a code word for “the government says I have to moderately adjust my lifestyle in a way that slightly inconveniences me”.

“Can man-made solutions actually be effective globally?”
It’s a man-made problem, so of course there can be a man-made solution.

I understand that cars CAN kill people.  I disagree that cars, when used for their intended purpose, are equally lethal to guns.

But fine, let's pretend that guns are regulated the same way as cars.

When you buy a car/gun, it has an identification number that is registered with government officials.

You are legally required to pass a test with other government officials to prove that you are physically and mentally suitable to use a car/gun.  If you pass the test, you get a license, including a picture ID and another number registered with government officials, allowing you to operate a car/gun.  You must pay a fee for this license, and renew it at regular intervals by retaking the tests.

You are legally required to carry and pay for insurance on your car/gun.  You must maintain it in safe condition -- to be verified by periodic inspections by other government officials -- and operate it safely and in accordance with the laws.

If you break any of these laws -- if you operate an illegally acquired gun, or operate a legally acquired gun without a valid license, or fail to register your gun, or let the insurance on your gun drop, or operate your gun under the influence, etc. -- your license to operate a gun is taken away from you.  If you get caught more than once, you go to jail.",4,0,1476,1476,,1476,530SSState,Cicerothesage,0
But there are a lot of regulations with driving,"To be fair, a more targeted approach to gun control is a fantastic idea!

I’m unlikely to know whether you have a degree prior to knowing what I think of your intelligence just from talking to you, in almost every case. 

I also put two kids through college in the past decade and they cost me around 100K each for bachelor’s degrees. And no one with a bachelor’s in something like philosophy is trying to get a job in philosophy. You need a graduate degree to do that. Any liberal arts degree like that is more or less interchangeable at the BA level and just earns you a seat at a desk somewhere pushing papers. Others have pointed out more flaws but in short, this entire thing is horseshit.

They revere the parents that actively subjugated them and then when they became adults reveled in the ability to be the one DOING the whoppin’ (similar to the once pledge 4 years ago senior gleefully looking forward to the hazing.) They know all this and they are bullies. 

They are supremacists, white or otherwise. They project as a way to alleviate the cognitive dissonance that comes from the rightful pushback to their insanity. If we are ever going to reach the ones who are in this camp yet aren’t too far gone or at least are decent at heart, we have to recognize this. They want trans people in camps. They want gays in camps. They want Jews gone, and blacks back under their control. They want these things even if not expressly desiring it because that is the endgame for these types of beliefs historically.",3,0,51,51,,51,Lstknt776,Tralan,0

"If you're *this* ass hurt about an all black show condemning slavery, than maybe you're the problem","The episode that they're whining about (though I doubt they bothered to look up the context) is called, *Juneteenth*, with the plot centering around an upcoming celebration of the town's founder, Christian A. Smith. There is very little if any information on Smith prior to 1900, and when one of the characters stumbles across a written account from the 1800s that exposes Smith as a slave owner she becomes determined to end the celebration and have the statue of him removed.

The Proud Family stages a protest during the festival, Wizard Kelly has them arrested, and after a month of negotiations, the town chooses to take down the statue and replace it with one of a slave girl that Smith owned named Emily and renamed the town as Emilyville.

Honestly, the history buff in me is deeply irked by the underlying message that, ""History is Written by the Winners"" (and it doesn't make a lot of sense that a slaveowner would hide that past in the first place). That said, I think the whole episode strikes me as a counterpoint to the Simpsons', *Lisa the Iconoclast* from season 16, where Lisa finds out that the town's founder, Jebediah Springfield is actually a notorious fiend, but when she had the option of exposing him at the festival honoring him, she chose to keep quiet to keep everybody happy.",41,0,941,941,,941,kourtbard,BillyManHansSr,0

Remember the history... selectively,"Ironically it is a sentiment I agree with but it’s telling that the shelf of books shown is all the sort of books written by British professors as the “definitive” history of the sort published in the early/mid 20th century and has a very specific tone that is the kind of historical writing that we now find dated and wearing racist/ethnocentric/colonialist blinders. It can be interesting reading but they tend to misinterpret or ignore the stuff that doesn’t fit their view so there is a lot missing. The missing stuff is what is being discovered and newly interpreted and emphasized in more recent work. So on one hand they want to say history happened, it’s immutable, and pour concrete on the version of the story that they are most comfortable with.

Events happen. People do stuff. They do it in specific ways and on specific dates. This is the part that is immutable.

How we understand what happened, the way the stories are told—that changes as we expand our understanding and the sources we regard as valid. And the story of what stories we chose in the past and why is such an important part of the story too. For example, I think it’s much more important to understanding modern America to understand the “myth of the lost cause” period of popular southern history that reigned supreme well into the 60s and still heavily influenced the worldview of the people who screech about CRT all the time, more than the battles and dates of the actual Civil War. Because it wasn’t just the story itself, it’s the way it was propped up and reinforced by popular culture and historical re-enactments, and those stupid statues too. When they say they want to go back to the older better days, they want to go back to the days when only what white men did and thought was considered the important story.

In fact, buying a house is probably the best example of how having a deficit can be a good thing.  Borrowing money to buy a house, in the long run, ends up being far more profitable when you pay it off, since the alternative is just paying rent for eternity, never actually building any equity.

"does grandma not ""back the blue""?","For the sake of argument, a Conservative agrees with you that cops can’t protect you with guns and asserts that only self ownership of a gun can stop crime.

But here’s the problem. Crimes like assault, murder, and rape often happen between close relatives or spouses, familiars who already have trust and access to those firearms, and crimes like burglaries require that the thievery occur while the house is unoccupied. Firearms in both of these cases cannot stop a crime because the crime either.

A. Is already happening.

B. Already happened.

C. The criminal also had access to firearms.

I never understood why someone would need a gun to protect themselves from things that just happen out of someone’s immediate control.

Of course, the truth is that most of the chickens murdering other chickens are doing it with the exact same motivation the foxes have when they summarily execute chickens with slightly differently colored feathers - they want foxes and chickens in fox costumes to continue oppressing the chickens they don’t like.

It was proven she used bleachbyte software on the computers and phones she was using which were to be subpoenaed and the word “classified” was cutoff on actual classified documents found in her possession & email distribution.

Hence why the left thinks Hillary did nothing wrong and the right thinks Hillary was never held accountable for crimes she was proven to have been involved in.

Two distinct universes we find ourselves in.

Ya know, some leftie circles just are in favor of regulating them.

I mean, I'm european and I want to get a gun license so I can legally keep my grandpa's heirloom pistol. Also there's talk Portugal is effectively going to outright ban them by making the firearms you own, dysfunctional.
I don't want that for my grandpa's pistol.

By no means was my grandpa highly progressive, he was more of a proper centrist (not like the fuckers who call themselves centrist but are always leaning in some regard right wing or against changing the status quo except for right wing policies cus let's be honest, they are just background noise), considering the regime he lived in where you'd rat out suspected socialists or communists to the fucking discount Gestapo.

Edit:
Idk why I'm disliked, it's not like I'll actually use it, it's just for me it's a violation of it to basically break it. It's the only thing I have relating to him as he was the grandpa that I actually stayed with the most time. Paternal one not so much but it's not really due to a lack of love towards me as they have been assisting in paying my studies.

As for the centrist comment, I mean he had actually interacted with socialists and communists and never ratted them out, despite Estado Novo rewarding you handsomely for it. Like, do I even need to fucking show you propaganda posters to tell you how militantly anti-communist it was?

You want to know what's actually fucked, my dad who after identifying as gay and leaving my mom (understandable), not visiting me for years and then finally visiting me and then not only defooing me for no reason (during father's day no less), but saying that he's not at all proud of me graduating my BSc and calling my mother a manipulative leech. And now I have thoughts about actual patricide (even if it gave me a life sentence) or at least actually weaponizing homophobia to strike a nerve to him. I want to do anything to hurt him, the same way he hurt me and my family. He has a tendency of throwing a hissy fit about paying for my studies despite the divorce because it's portuguese law until I reach 25. For Christ's sake, he even pulled my medical insurance, that's how much of an asshole he is. Previously, I blamed my lack of initiative for not asking my dad to visit me during my earlier years, but I can see he doesn't fucking care or love me in the slightest and during his ""straight days"" he was fucking sexist scum as noted by his favourite dentistry which had a pretty sexist dentist.",-1,0,2025,2025,,2025,RT-OM,Cicerothesage,0

"Yes, the good old days when people judged you if you didn't wear dresses and suits to go shopping!","Remember, back then clothes were made by union workers not sweatshops, so things were better made overall. The idea of dressing nicer to go to town was considered respectful to yourself and others. You didn't necessarily have to dress up, more like just put on something that wasn't work clothes. A lot of people had come through the depression or had a childhood in a rural area. Coming out of those kind of circumstances, it probably feels like you are progressing in life rather than regressing.

My grandfather worked on the family farm as a kid but grew up and worked in department stores in the big cities. Eventually he worked during WW2-1960s at Lockheed in the machine shop, so he went through all kinds of different dress requirements. I remember him having a good natured chuckle in the early 1980s at my boyfriend's jeans with the holes at the knees or my purple overalls. He just found it funny that some things he tried hard to get away from having to wear was now fashionable. I found a different perspective seeing it from his experience. 

The world has gone from dressy to casual to comatose. The influx of cheap sweatshop labor clothes is everything now. That has an effect on the general mindset of people and a society as one loses influence on how we perceive ourselves. Cheaply made goods (expenisve can still be cheaply made, so its not about price) can make you feel cheap but if you never experienced better, you  just start accepting that this is the way it is.

"Has anyone on the left unironically complained about gas stoves? I haven’t seen anything, but conservatives are running with this narrative.","Conservatives do this about any recommendations about a product or activity.

A glaring example of this that drove it home to me happened 20 years ago or so, and it involved Rush Limbaugh. Shocking, I know. He's the one who started doing this as far as I can tell.

An audiologist at a prominent medical school conducted a study regarding the decibel level at pro football games. He measured them, listed the decibel level at each, and for the loudest ones made the recommendation that wearing ear protection might be a good idea, especially for young children. I have no idea why, but I read the paper and so was aware of EXACTLY what the conclusions drawn were, and how they were recommended.

Again, no idea why, but I happened to be within earshot of Rush a week or so later, and heard him go OFF about how liberals want to kill football, that they are planning on banning it and that the ENTIRE AUDIOLOGY COMMUNITY had been captured by The Left.

I knew this was flat-out untrue, that at no point was there a recommendation to ban football games, not attend football games, etc. One example given in the paper that Arrowhead (where the Chiefs play) can be louder than a 747 taking off, and that even a relatively short exposure can damage your hearing.

That's it. Just a person with knowledge of hearing and the human ear putting out information so citizens can make informed decisions for themselves and their loved ones. But El Rushbo turned up the gas and made it all about Lib overreach and their coming after Real America^(TM) and Freedom yadda yadda yadda.

Same thing here. A group who studies these things has evidence that gas stoves are dangerous, and can lead to respiratory issues in children (for example). Important info for parents, at least.

Time is spent discussing your problems in the here-and-now, with reference to your background and your childhood only when relevant. Together we target self-defeating behaviors and thinking, rather than focusing on psychopathology. Dr. Hurd provides answers in terms you can understand, helping you find solutions to problems in the here-and-now, with a special emphasis on discovering alternatives to the ""victim mentality"" of blaming everything on your family, ""society"" or your biological make-up.

There were 201 sports-related adult deaths at an incidence rate of 0.76-1.49 per 100,000 participant-years. Of the deaths, 74% were witnessed. Of the adult cases, 68% (n = 136) were due to cardiac causes, with coronary artery disease the most frequent cause (n = 90 [45%]). Structural abnormalities were common in adult cardiac deaths; 51 (38%) had cardiac weight ≥500 g, and 75 (55%) had left ventricular wall thickness >15 mm. Of the 15 child deaths, 5 (33%) were arrhythmogenic or presumed arrhythmic, and 5 (33%) were inherited cardiomyopathies (2 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 3 arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy).",6,0,95,95,,95,uisqebaugh,Cicerothesage,0

I can see the view point that they are an unnecessary glorification of past harms. I can see how that glorification would cause people today to not want to see them. 

But I think this is a teachable moment. 

I think the right move would be to add to these monuments. Not only real information, unbiased facts about what they glorify, but also provide opportunities to create competing monuments to allow for new expressions. 

The harm done in the past still exists. The generational harms still exist. Taking down this monument and others like it just take away an opportunity to use it as a marker and educational tool for understanding what harms were perpetrated and how. 

Its really no different a concept than displaying Nazi memorabilia in a museum in Poland or Germany. It shouldn’t be for glorification. It should be for an opportunity to learn about the past and from the past.",-47,0,751,751,,751,faithOver,BillyManHansSr,0

when you die you get a death certificate that explains your cause of death and the circumstances, this information presumably is entered into a database that staticians/the government/medical institutions have access to in order to build data sets and draw conclusions from, data is infinitely more important and widely used than most people have any comprehension of apparently because without it most of society would be completely incapable of functioning. 

even if someone within the system had an incentive to alter information like this, it would have to be done at the base level, and at this level youre talking about hundreds of thousands if not millions of people each individually choosing to falsify information. in order to believe this is possible you would have to believe in a multi MILLION person conspiracy, as each of these data entry people would need a network of other people cooperating to exchange information and compensation etc. 

this massive conspiracy is dismissible on face value (extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. all it would take is one or a few people to take pictures and go to the news to monetize their experience which they clearly have no qualms with doing evil things for money etc.) 

so without it, what incentive does anyone have? theyre not getting paid and theyre ruining the utility of a system EVERYONE, especially them, relies on. its complete nonsense. the only people pushing this kind of shit are banking on your fear and inability to get informed so they can capitalize on you somehow, probably by selling you a bucket of dehydrated food lol",5,0,1485,1485,,1485,Pistonenvy,Cicerothesage,0

The complexity of counting COVID deaths and how different metrics were used is discussed in this article from the UK government’s Health Security Agency:

https://ukhsa.blog.gov.uk/2020/08/12/behind-the-headlines-counting-covid-19-deaths/

Edit to add… 

Conspiracy-minded people could pick these selective out-of-context quotes from that 2020 article… 

>	other causes of death are included… It was decided to adopt this measure in April in order to be sure not to underestimate the number of COVID-19 related deaths.

But…
>	It was always intended to review the approach as the pandemic progressed.

The article points out that the UK had recently started reporting COVID deaths based on COVID being mentioned on the death certificate, as well as reporting them using the death-within-28 days metric.

Now I am a BSc in Nuclear Tech, but am taking a masters in Nuclear science and applications, which is a broad umbrella that covers human biology beyond just dose deposition in tissue. 

I took a bit of an educated guess in regards to arrhythmia being capable of causing it and was correct. During sports, if you over-exert your heart for a relatively prolonged period of time, it's 2 beats which correspond to the entry and exit of blood in the ventricles (I think) will de-synchronize, and since the heart utilizes pressure differentials to put the blood in and out, less blood is drawn and thus less pressure difference, resulting in lesser beats and finally ending in cardiac arrest.

Funnily enough, it's mechanics are quite similar to tumours for different reasons, they are kind of ""silent deaths"".

Why tumours? Well that's a whole topic and that's something I feel personally am more qualified as I feel that wrote a lit review under the required 2k page limit because I literally ran out of content to say.

Ask below if you interested in derailing this topic into the Andromeda Galaxy to explain the mechanics of tumours and how there's a treatment method in experimental phase that holds lots of promise and potential both in theory and practice. It's surprisingly rudimentary but it's mechanisms are interesting.

Anyways sorry for the derail, just wanted to say that and also there are health problems that kids can face that are utterly mortifying honestly. As a small child, I had constant otitis and every doctor led me basically to nowhere. Only one, however did and he still accompanies me to this day. Had it not been him, I literally could have lost the ability to hear in one of my ears and that's no exaggeration. I'm willing to bet lots of kids weren't as lucky and that's a whole topic and a half to discuss about my country's healthcare system, which is mostly privatised, but not US level exploitative, but that still bars people from life saving shit.



If you skipped to the end, grandma never even paid attention to biology if ever, I had to explain my grandma that Mercury is bad just for reference... To be fair she thought it wasn't cus it was used in Betadine's old formula, in the form of Mercurochrome, now it's Povidone Iodine, but it was changed not because the mercury caused any noticeable damage, but as a precaution by the FDA in anything mercury related and that it can be changed back if a peer reviewed study can conclude that the previous formula won't cause any noticeable impairment throught a person's lifetime, something that'd require lots of funds to begin with.
Not that Iodine itself is flawless, it can result in iodine poisoning since although iodine is essential for thyroid function (hence why chlorine in your system is bad as it replaces iodine as both share the same group and therefore chemical behaviour, similar to WHY you shouldn't drink heavy water), too much iodine is bad for your body, like most nutrients.",7,0,426,426,,426,RT-OM,Cicerothesage,0

Still! Even with that correction, that's a staggering amount of people by any measure and a human tragedy worth responding to through collective action and prevention. I don't see how an AFV at the border is going to stop the problem, though, but whatever.

Well, according to the CDC, from Jan 5th 2022 to Jan 4th 2023 about 257,000 people have died from COVID. That works out to an average of 700 people a day.

Psalms 82:3-4

Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.

Proverbs 21:12-13

The Righteous One takes note of the house of the wicked and brings the wicked to ruin. Whoever shuts their ears to the cry of the poor will also cry out and not be answered.

Matthew 6:1-2

Beware of practicing your piety before others in order to be seen by them; for then you have no reward from your Father in heaven. So whenever you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be praised by others.

Matthew 6:5

And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that they may be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.

Matthew 7:1-3

Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

Matthew 19:24

Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.

Matthew 21:12-13

Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. ""It is written,” he said to them, “ ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you are making it ‘a den of robbers.’ ""

Galatians 3:28

There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.

Luke 3:11

“Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same.”

Timothy 6:9-10

Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.

THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  “How silently, how silently, **the wondrous Gift is given**.”

There is a certain stillness at the center of the Christmas story.  A silent night when all the world goes quiet and all the glamour, all the noise, everything that divides us, everything that pits us against one another, everything — everything that seems so important but really isn’t, this all fades away in stillness of the winter’s evening. 

And we look to the sky, to a lone star, shining brighter than all the rest, guiding us to **the birth of a child** — **a child Christians believe to be the son of God**; miraculously now, here among us on Earth, bringing hope, love and peace and joy to the world.

Yes, it’s a story that’s 2,000 years old, but it’s still very much alive today.  Just look into the eyes of a child
on Christmas morning, or listen to the laughter of a family together this holiday season after years — after years of being apart.  Just feel the hope rising in your chest as you sing “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing,” even though you’ve sung the countless times before.

Yes, even after 2,000 years, Christmas still has the power to lift us up, to bring us together, to change lives, to change the world.

The Christmas story is at the heart of the Christmas — Christian faith.  But the message of hope, love, peace, and joy, they’re also universal.

It speaks to all of us, whether we’re Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, or any other faith, or no faith at all.  It speaks to all of us as human beings who are here on this Earth to care for one another, to look out for one another, to love one another.

The message of Christmas is always important, but it’s especially important through tough times, like the ones we’ve been through the past few years.

The pandemic has taken so much from us.  We’ve lost so much time with one another.  We’ve lost so many people — people we loved.  Over a million lives lost in America alone.  That’s a million empty chairs breaking hearts in homes all across the country.

Our politics has gotten so angry, so mean, so partisan.  And too often we see each other as enemies, not as neighbors; as Democrats or Republicans, not as fellow Americans.  We’ve become too divided.

But as tough as these times have been, if we look a little closer, we see bright spots all across the country: the strength, the determination, the resilience that’s long defined America.

We’re surely making progress.  Things are getting better.  COVID lon- — no longer controls our lives.  Our kids are back in school.  People are back to work.  In fact, more people are working than ever before.

Americans are building again, innovating again, dreaming again.

So my hope this Christmas season is that we take a few moments of quiet reflection and find that stillness in the heart of Christmas — that’s at the heart of Christmas, and look — really look at each other, not as Democrats or Republicans, not as members of “Team Red” or “Team Blue,” but as who we really are: fellow Americans.  Fellow human beings worthy of being treated with dignity and respect.

I sincerely hope this holiway [sic] se- — this holiday season will drain the poison that has infected our politics and set us against one another.

I hope this Christmas season marks a fresh start for our nation, because there is so much that unites us as Americans, so much more that unites us than divides us.

We’re truly blessed to live in this nation.  And I truly hope we take the time to look out — look out for one another.   Not at one — for one another.

So many people struggle at Christmas.  It can be a time of great pain and terrible loneliness.  I know, like many of you know. 

It was 50 years ago this week that I lost my first wife and my infant daughter in a car accident, and my two sons were badly injured, when they were out shopping for a Christmas tree.  I know how hard this time of year can be.

But here’s what I learned long ago: No one — no one can ever know what someone else is going through, what’s really going on in their life, what they’re struggling with, what they’re trying to overcome.

That’s why sometimes the smallest act of kindness can mean so much.  A simple smile.  A hug.  An unexpected phone call.  A quiet cup of coffee.  Simple acts of kindness that can lift a spirit, provide compo- — comfort, and perhaps maybe even save a life.

So, this Christmas, let’s spread a little kindness.

This Christmas, let’s be that — that helping hand, that strong shoulder, that friendly voice when no one else seems to care for those who are struggling, in trouble, in need.  It just might be the best gift you can ever give.

And let’s be sure to remember the brave women and men in uniform who defend and protect our nation.  Many of them — many of them are away from their families at this time of year.  Let’s keep them in our prayers.

You know, and I believe Christmas is a season of hope.  And throughout the life of this country, it’s been during the weeks of December — even in the midst of some of our toughest days — that some of the best chapters of our story have been written.

It was during these weeks back in 1862 that President Lincoln prepared the Emancipation Proclamation, which he issued on New Year’s Day.

At Christmas 1941, in the week — weeks after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt hosted Winston Churchill in this White House.  Together, they planned the Allied strategy to defeat fascism and autocracy.

And it was 1968 that the most terrible year — of years — a year of assassination and riot, of war and chaos — that the astronauts of Apollo 8 circled the Moon and spoke to us here on Earth.

From the silence of space, **on a silent night on a Christmas Eve, they read the story of Christmas — Creation from the King James Bible.  It went: “In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth.  And God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light.”**

That light is still with us, illuminating our way forward as Americans and as citizens of the world.  **A light that burned in the beginning and at Bethlehem**.  A light that shines still today in our own time, our own lives.

As we sing “O’ Holy Night” — **“His law is love, and His Gospel is peace”** — may I wish you and for you, and for our nation, now and always, is that we’ll live in the light — the light of liberty and hope, of love and generosity, of kindness and compassion, of dignity and decency.

So, from the Biden family, we wish you and your family peace, joy, health, and happiness.

Merry Christmas.  Happy Holidays.  And all the best in the New Year.

God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops.  Thank you.

Honestly too, I only highlighted places that directly reference Jesus. A person could be more liberal and highlight everything that is Christian-related and still make grandma's point look ABSOLUTELY stupid. You don't have to use the word Jesus to mean Jesus. Words mean things, grandma. This is bending over backwards to be outrage about the war on Christianity. Biden clearly tried to be inclusive with his speech, but also express his Catholic faith and grandma is tripped up because it doesn't directly say Jesus. pathetic",27,0,105,105,,105,Cicerothesage,Thatoneguythatsweird,0

I think if you’re over the age of 50, where covid can affect you the most, then you should rightly consider getting a vaccine. But this ‘jab all no matter what’ approach is overzealous.

>The memo suggests that candidates express their “sincerity and concern” about the environment, but he also wanted them to downplay concerns.

>Using focus groups, Luntz discovered that ” ‘climate change’ sounds less frightening than ‘global warming,’ ” the memo explained.

>“While global warming has catastrophic connotations attached to it, climate change suggests a more controllable and less emotional challenge.”

2. Didn't read 1984 and don't understand how language was used by the INGSOC party. Words in that book were stripped of description or meaning to simple repeadted adjectives, reducing the pool of words to describe something so you can't accurately speak your mind. The definition of a woman has changed but it still describes a woman.

He's a petty crook.

Michael Byrd also indirectly *saved* the lives of all the other traitors banging on that door, because they knew they’d be shot if they continued their attempts to enter and harm our members of Congress. They should all be thanking him for the gift of another sunrise.

Also, I find it quite interesting that when a white cop shoots a back person—even when the video evidence shows us the cop was in the wrong—conservatives in this country bend over backwards to defend that cop and claim that none of us were in his shoes and couldn’t possibly know what he was experiencing. Here we have a black man who defended our country at great personal risk to himself—he stood his ground and did not cut and run when a violent mob was attempting to harm others—and conservatives are calling for his arrest. *Fuck them*.

When the barbarians are at the gates, we should all be thankful that people like Michael Byrd are willing to stand between us and them, and we should all go apeshit when, after the smoke clears, *some* in our country want to punish our defenders.
